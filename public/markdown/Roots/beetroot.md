## General Information
**Generic name:** Beetroot
**Sri Lankan name:** Beetroot
**Scientific name:** Beta vulgaris
**Plant family:** Amaranthaceae
**Edible parts:** The red tubers are eaten after cooking. In some instances, the root is also dried and powdered after which the flour mixed with barley or wheat. They can be pickled or fermented as beetroot juice. They are often boiled, sliced and served with vinegar. The leaves are edible and can be cooked in soups and stews.
**Type of plant:** It is a temperate climate plant and hence mainly grows in the highlands between 1150 and 2600 m altitude in the tropics. 

**Nutrition value:** <update>High in fiber, vitamin C, potassium, and manganese. A 100g serving provides approximately 43 calories.</update>

**Companion plants:**
- Helped by broccoli, bush beans, cabbage, lettuce, kohlrabi, onions, brassicas, passion fruit.
**Non-companion plants:**
- Avoid runner or pole beans.

## Description:
Beetroot is a dark green leafed plant up to 20 cm tall and grows throughout the year. It has an oval shape with dark green or reddish in colour. It gives a thickened root in the first year followed by flowers in the second year. The flowers are small and green. The leaves vary in shape and colour. It has a round or elongated fattened root. The root is red in colour though there are also white varieties. There are many different varieties of beets, showcasing deep red, yellow, white, or striped roots of different shapes.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Mid-April to late June

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Sow seeds ½-inch deep and 1 to 2 inches apart in rows that are about 12 to 18 inches apart. After sowing, cover the seeds with a thin layer of soil. |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Need deep dug, rock free soil, fertilized, well drained soil. The beds should be fertilized normally, though adding a teaspoon of borax per thirty-two-square-foot bed is a good idea because beets are sensitive to boron deficiency. Adding compost will aid the process. |
| Soil | Need deep dug, rock free soil, fertilized, well drained soil. The beds should be fertilized normally, though adding a teaspoon of borax per thirty-two-square-foot bed is a good idea because beets are sensitive to boron deficiency. Adding compost will aid the process. |
| Water | Need to water regularly to maintain moisture in soil. |
| Light | Partial shade, Full sun |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | As it requires a temperate climate, the plant grows best at 18-22°C and are frost resistant. Temperatures below 10°C cause the plant to start its seeding phase. |
|----|----|
| Soil | Soil needs to have regular moisture to speed up germination. Beets need to maintain plenty of moisture in order to grow well. |
| Water | Water the beetroot regularly to reduce the likelihood of the roots becoming woody or splitting. During the first month water every couple of days until the seeds have germinated. |
| Pruning | <update>Pinch off flower stalks if you want to prevent bolting and encourage more leaf growth.</update> |
| Weed control | <update>Keep the area clean by removing weeds regularly to reduce competition for nutrients and moisture.</update> |

## Harvesting:
It can be harvested once it has grown couple of inches from the ground.**Grasp the foliage firmly where it meets the top of the root and pull. Beetroot is better harvested too early rather than too late – younger roots are more tender. Beets should be harvested when they are no larger than 2” in diameter.**

## Curing:
<update>After harvesting, cure beetroots by storing them in a dark, humid place at around 50°F (10°C) for about two weeks to improve their flavor and storage life.</update>

## Storage
<update>Store cured beetroots in the refrigerator for up to three months or in the freezer for up to one year. To freeze, first blanch the beetroots for five minutes, then cool them quickly before placing in a sealed bag in the freezer.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Seldom have pest issues. However, leaf miners and other beet-specific pests spread from weeds.

**Symptoms:** <update>Leaf miners cause serpentine mines on leaves, while aphids can cause distorted leaves and sticky honeydew.</update>

**Control method:** It is important to keep the area clean by removing weeds and crop rotation to avoid the problem.
### Disease Control
**Disease type:** <update>Beetroot can be affected by diseases such as powdery mildew, Cercospora leaf spot, and root rot.</update>

**Symptoms:** <update>Powdery mildew causes white patches on leaves, Cercospora leaf spot appears as dark spots with yellow haloes, and root rot causes blackened roots and wilting plants.</update>

**Management:** <update>Avoid overhead watering to prevent fungal diseases. Practice crop rotation and maintain good air circulation around plants. Apply fungicides if necessary.</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Beetroot can be challenging in the wet zone due to high humidity, which increases the risk of fungal diseases like powdery mildew and root rot.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Monitor plants closely for signs of disease.
- Ensure good air circulation around plants by spacing them appropriately.
- Consider using fungicides if necessary.
### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Beetroot grows moderately well in the dry zone with proper watering and protection from strong winds.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Water regularly to maintain soil moisture, especially during the dry season.
- Provide some shade during hot periods to prevent heat stress.
### Mid country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** The moderate climate of the mid country is suitable for beetroot cultivation with minimal effort.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Minimal challenges, but monitor plants for pests and diseases.
- Ensure soil moisture is maintained during dry periods.
### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Beetroot can be challenging in the up country due to cooler temperatures, shorter growing seasons, and potential frost damage.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure soil is well-drained to prevent root rot.
- Provide some protection from frost during colder periods using row covers or other methods.
- Consider starting seeds indoors or using transplants to extend the growing season.
