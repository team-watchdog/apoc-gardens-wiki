## Description:
Two types of radish are commonly grown in Sri Lanka. Beeralu Rabu and Japanese ball. Radish belongs to the family Brassicaceae which can be grown in all agro-climatic zones of Sri Lanka. Varieties of radish are now broadly distributed around the world, but almost no archeological records are available to help determine their early history and domestication. However, scientists have tentatively located the origin of Raphanus sativus in Southeast Asia, as this is the only region where truly wild forms have been discovered.

<update>In Sri Lanka, radish cultivation is particularly popular in the upcountry regions like Nuwara Eliya and Bandarawela, where the cooler climate is favorable for its growth.</update>

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>Radish can be planted throughout the year in Sri Lanka. However, it grows best during the cooler months of October to February.</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Direct seeding. Soils should be ploughed to a depth of 30-40 cm to provide the necessary depth. Spacing should be 25-30 cm between rows; and 10 cm between plants. Sow seeds in rows on raised beds. |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Direct seeding |
| Soil | Well-drained soils are suitable, poorly drained soils can cause growth problems. A pH range of 6.0 – 7.5 is appropriate for cultivation. Radish can grow in Sand, Loam, Clay, Acidic, Neutral and Alkaline soils. |
| Water | Irrigate daily for the first 4-5 days and then every 3-4 days, depending on rainfall |
| Light | Requires plenty of sunlight |
| Fertiliser / Mulch | Apply a balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) at planting time. Mix it into the top inch of soil. <update>In Sri Lanka, organic fertilizers like compost or well-rotted cow dung are commonly used.</update>

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Grows well even in dry zone conditions, but prefers cooler temperatures between 65°F - 75°F (18°C - 24°C). |
|----|----|
| Soil | Well-drained soils are suitable, poorly drained soils can cause growth problems. A pH range of 6.0 – 7.5 is appropriate for cultivation. |
| Water | Irrigate daily for the first 4-5 days and then every 3-4 days, depending on rainfall |
| Pruning | No pruning required.
| Weed control | Keep the area around radish plants weed-free to prevent competition for nutrients and water.

## Harvesting:
Radish can be harvested 30-45 days after germination. Monitor plants to ensure that they are harvested at the correct maturity stage. Most radishes are fully mature after 50 days.

## Curing: 
 <update>After harvesting, cure radishes by storing them in a humid environment with temperatures between 32°F - 40°F (0°C - 4°C) for about two weeks. </update>

## Storage: 
<update>Store cured radishes in the refrigerator crisper drawer for up to four weeks. Alternatively, they can be frozen for up to six months. In rural Sri Lanka, radishes are often stored in cool, dry places or in traditional clay pots filled with sand to maintain freshness.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Leaf miner, caterpillars, cutworm

**Symptoms:** <update>Leaf miners cause serpentine mines on leaves. Caterpillars create holes in leaves and may defoliate plants. Cutworms feed on seedlings at the soil line.</update>

**Control method:** A diluted neem oil solution works well as an organic pesticide. For caterpillars, plough soil, pick up and discard caterpillars hiding in the soil. Caterpillars in the soil are also eaten by birds when the soil is ploughed. <update>In Sri Lanka, traditional pest control methods like using wood ash or crushed neem leaves are also common.</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** Alternaria leaf spot, Black leg root rot

**Symptoms:** Alternaria leaf spot causes dark spots with yellow halos on leaves. Black leg root rot causes black lesions on roots and stems.

**Management:** Rotate crops to prevent disease buildup. Maintain good air circulation around plants. Use fungicides as a last resort. <update>In Sri Lanka, farmers often use natural fungicides like a mixture of garlic and chili spray to control fungal diseases.</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Radish can be challenging in the wet zone due to high humidity and potential fungal diseases.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Monitor plants closely for disease signs.
- Ensure good air circulation around plants.
<update>- Use raised beds to improve drainage in areas with heavy rainfall.</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Radish grows well in the dry zone with adequate irrigation.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Irrigate regularly to maintain soil moisture.
- Protect plants from strong winds.
<update>- Use mulching to conserve soil moisture in the dry climate.</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Radish can be moderately challenging in the mid country due to varying temperatures and rainfall.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide shade during hot periods.
- Ensure consistent watering.
<update>- Choose varieties that are well-adapted to mid-country conditions.</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Radish may struggle in the up country due to cooler temperatures and potential frost.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Protect plants from frost using row covers or mulch.
- Provide additional warmth with black plastic mulch.
<update>- Time planting to coincide with the warmer months in the up country region.</update>
