## Description:
Leeks belong to the onion family (_Alliaceae_) but do not form bulbs. They have a mild onion flavor and are commonly used in soups, as well as eaten raw, braised, or in casseroles or quiche. In Sri Lanka, leeks are commonly used in various curries, soups, and stir-fries, adding a subtle onion-like flavor to dishes. It's best suited for cool climatic conditions in up-country areas like Nuwara Eliya and Badulla.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** mid-March to mid-May for seed sowing. This timing aligns with the cooler climatic conditions that are favorable for leek growth, particularly in the upcountry areas like Nuwara Eliya and Badulla, where leeks thrive best due to the cooler temperatures

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Seedlings or seeds |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Prepare 1.2 x 3 m size raised beds. Make holes 40 cm deep and roughly 15cm apart, in rows wide enough apart to allow space for maneuvering. Pour a little water into each hole, and push the leeks down into the mud |
| Soil | Well-drained soil with high organic matter. Best pH range is 5-6 |
| Water | Regular irrigation, especially important in the first 4 days after transplanting |
| Light | Needs full sunshine at least for 6 hours of the day |

### Growing conditions:
| Temperatures | Thrives in cooler temperatures of 15-25°C, making it suitable for upcountry regions |
|----|----|
| Soil | Leeks like rich loam, but they can, and often do, put up with practically anything. Better to provide them with plenty of manure and plenty of compost |
| Water | Light irrigation in the morning to avoid leaf scorching |
| Pruning | No pruning required |
| Weed control | Hand-pull weeds or use organic herbicides |

## Harvesting:
Harvest leeks by either gently twisting and pulling them from the earth, or digging and lifting them. A quality leek should have a firm, white shaft more than three inches long.

## Curing:
After harvesting, cure leeks by cutting off the roots and tops, then store in a cool, humid place for about two weeks.

## Storage
Store cured leeks in the refrigerator for up to 3 months or freeze them for later use. Where refrigerators are not available leeks can be stored in cool, dry places.

## Protecting Your Plants
### Pest Control
**Pest type:**
- Leafminers (Lyriomyza spp.)
- Onion maggot (Delia antiqua)
- Thrips (Thrips tabaci, Frankliniella occidentalis)

**Symptoms:**
- **Leafminers:** Thin, white, winding trails on leaves; white blotches; premature leaf drop.
- **Onion maggot:** Stunted or wilting seedlings; plants breaking at soil line; deformed bulbs.
- **Thrips:** Leaves turning silver to gray; twisted and dying leaves; scarring of leaves.

**Control method:**
- **Leafminers:** Check transplants before planting; remove plants after harvest; use insecticides only when damage is identified.
- **Onion maggot:** Practice good sanitation; remove all bulbs at season end; use floating row covers; apply appropriate granular insecticides if necessary.
- **Thrips:** Avoid planting near grain fields; use overhead irrigation; apply appropriate insecticides at first sign of damage.

### Disease Control

**Disease type:**
- Botrytis leaf blight (Botrytis squamosa)
- Damping-off (Fusarium spp.)
- Downy mildew (Peronospora parasitica)
- Pink root (Phoma terrestris)
- Purple blotch (Alternaria porri)
- White rot (Sclerotinia cepivorum)

**Symptoms:**
- **Botrytis leaf blight:** Small white lesions with light green halos; leaf blighting.
- **Damping-off:** Rotting seeds; discolored root tips; wilting seedlings.
- **Downy mildew:** Pale spots on leaves; gray-purple fuzzy growth; yellowing leaves.
- **Pink root:** Pink to purple roots; transparent, water-soaked roots; stunted plants.
- **Purple blotch:** Water-soaked lesions on leaves or stalk; brown to purple lesions with red or purple margins.
- **White rot:** Yellowing older leaves; stunted growth; fluffy white growth on bulb base.

**Management:**
- Ensure good air circulation by proper spacing between plants.
- Use well-draining soil and avoid overwatering.
- Practice crop rotation with non-allium species.
- Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
- Use disease-resistant varieties when available.
- Apply appropriate fungicides or insecticides when necessary, following local regulations and guidelines.
- For specific diseases:
  - **Botrytis leaf blight:** Plant in single rows with good spacing; time irrigation for quick drying; apply fungicides when plants have at least five true leaves.
  - **Damping-off:** Use disease-free seed; treat seed with fungicide; rotate crops; consider soil steaming or fumigation.
  - **Downy mildew:** Avoid infected sets; rotate crops; plant in well-draining areas; destroy infected debris; apply appropriate fungicides.
  - **Pink root:** Use long crop rotations (3-6 years); plant resistant varieties; consider soil solarization or fumigation.
  - **Purple blotch:** Use long rotations; reduce leaf wetness; apply and rotate appropriate fungicides.
  - **White rot:** Avoid transferring soil between sites; treat seeds with hot water; use long-term rotation; apply fungicides if available.

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 8/10)
**Explanation:** Leeks are challenging to grow in the wet zone due to high humidity, potential fungal diseases, and temperatures that are higher than ideal for leeks.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Monitor for and manage fungal diseases, especially downy mildew, botrytis leaf blight, and white rot.
- Use raised beds to improve drainage during heavy monsoon rains.
- Ensure good air circulation by proper spacing between plants.
- Consider using disease-resistant varieties if available.
- Implement strict crop rotation with non-allium species to prevent soil-borne diseases.

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Leeks are difficult to grow in the dry zone due to high temperatures and water requirements that are not ideal for leek cultivation.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide adequate water, especially during hot periods, while avoiding overwatering.
- Use mulch to retain soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.
- Consider partial shade during the hottest parts of the day.
- Monitor for thrips, which favor hot, arid conditions.
- Choose heat-tolerant varieties if available.

### Mid country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Leeks are moderately challenging to grow in the mid country, as the climate is more suitable than the low country but still not ideal.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Monitor for pests and diseases, particularly thrips and fungal infections.
- Ensure consistent watering while maintaining good drainage.
- Implement crop rotation to prevent soil-borne diseases.
- Use companion planting with pest-repelling plants like marigolds.
- Balance sunlight exposure, aiming for at least 6 hours of full sun daily.

### Up country (Difficulty: 3/10)
**Explanation:** Leeks are well-suited to the cooler climate of Sri Lanka's up country regions, which closely matches their preferred growing conditions.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Monitor for pests like onion maggot and leafminers, which may still be present in cooler climates.
- Ensure proper spacing for good air circulation to prevent fungal diseases.
- Implement crop rotation with non-allium species to prevent soil-borne diseases.
- Use well-draining soil rich in organic matter to promote healthy growth.
- Time planting to avoid the coldest periods if frost is a concern in some areas.
