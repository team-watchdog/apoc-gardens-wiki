## Description:
Leeks vegetable belongs to Liliaceae family. They have a mild onion flavor. You may eat them in soups, as well as raw, braised or in casseroles or quiche.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>October to December (Maha season) in upcountry regions</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Using a long dibber, make holes eight inches (20 cm) deep and six inches (15 cm) apart, in rows wide enough apart to allow space for maneuvering. Pour a little water into each hole, and push the leeks down into the mud, roots first. |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Transplant seedlings or set seeds directly.
| Soil | They need moist but well-drained soil, and they like a high pH—between 6 and 8. <update>In Sri Lanka, adding compost or well-rotted manure to the soil is beneficial.</update>
| Water | <update>In Sri Lankan conditions, regular watering is crucial, especially during dry spells. Aim for consistent moisture without waterlogging.</update>
| Light | Needs full sunshine at least for 6 hours of the day

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | <update>Thrives in cooler temperatures of 15-25°C, making it suitable for upcountry regions in Sri Lanka</update>
|----|----|
| Soil | Leeks like rich loam, but they can, and often do, put up with practically anything. Better to provide them with plenty of manure and plenty of compost.
| Water | Leeks have shallow root systems and need to be watered frequently—roughly an inch per week—to thrive. <update>In drier regions of Sri Lanka, more frequent watering may be necessary.</update>
| Pruning | No pruning required.
| Weed control | Hand-pull weeds or use organic herbicides. <update>Mulching with organic materials can help suppress weeds in Sri Lankan conditions.</update>

## Harvesting:
Harvest leeks by either gently twisting and pulling them from the earth, or digging and lifting them. A quality leek should have a firm, white shaft more than three inches long. <update>In Sri Lanka, harvesting typically occurs 3-4 months after planting.</update>

## Curing:
<update>After harvesting, cure leeks by cutting off the roots and tops, then store in a cool, humid place for about two weeks.</update>

## Storage
Store cured leeks in the refrigerator for up to 3 months or freeze them for later use. <update>In Sri Lanka, where refrigeration might not always be available, leeks can be stored in a cool, dry place for a shorter period.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Leafminers, Onion maggot, Thrips

**Symptoms:** <update>Leafminers cause serpentine mines on leaves. Onion maggots cause wilting and yellowing of leaves.</update>

**Control method:** Apply insecticides, use row covers. <update>In Sri Lanka, neem-based pesticides are commonly used for organic pest control.</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** Leek rust, Downy mildew

**Symptoms:** Leek rust causes orange-brown spots on leaves. Downy mildew causes purple or brown spots with a white, fuzzy growth.

**Management:** Rotate crops, maintain good air circulation, apply fungicides if necessary. <update>In Sri Lanka's humid climate, ensuring proper spacing between plants is crucial for disease prevention.</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Leeks can be challenging to grow in the wet zone due to high humidity and potential fungal diseases.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Monitor for downy mildew and apply fungicides if necessary.
- Ensure good air circulation around plants.
<update>- Use raised beds to improve drainage in heavy monsoon rains.</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Leeks can be moderately difficult to grow in the dry zone due to high temperatures and water requirements.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide adequate water, especially during hot periods.
- Mulch to retain soil moisture.
<update>- Consider partial shade during the hottest parts of the day.</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Leeks are relatively easy to grow in the mid country with its moderate climate.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Monitor for pests and diseases.
- Ensure consistent watering.
<update>- Implement crop rotation to prevent soil-borne diseases.</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Leeks are well-suited to the cooler climate of Sri Lanka's up country regions.</update>
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Protect plants from frost with row covers or mulching.
- Provide adequate warmth during germination.
<update>- Capitalize on the cooler temperatures for optimal growth.</update>
