### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | <update>Seeds can be directly sown or stem cuttings can be used for faster propagation</update> |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Place plants at least a foot apart |
| Soil | <update>Well-drained, fertile soil rich in organic matter. Add compost or well-rotted manure before planting</update> |
| Water | <update>Regular watering is necessary, especially during dry spells. Mulching helps retain soil moisture</update> |
| Light | <update>Grows well in full sun but can tolerate partial shade, especially in hotter regions of Sri Lanka</update> |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | <update>Thrives in Sri Lanka's tropical temperatures, typically between 25-35Â°C</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | <update>Adapts to various soil types found in Sri Lanka, but prefers well-drained, loamy soil with a pH of 6.0-6.8</update> |
| Water | <update>Regular watering is crucial, especially during dry seasons. Drip irrigation or hand watering at the base of the plant is recommended</update> |
| Pruning | Pinch back growing tips to encourage bushier growth |
| Weed control | <update>Regular weeding is important. Use organic mulch to suppress weeds and retain soil moisture</update> |

## Harvesting:
<update>Harvest can begin 6-8 weeks after planting. Regular harvesting of young leaves and shoots encourages continued growth. In Sri Lanka, Malabar spinach can be harvested year-round with proper care.</update>

## Curing:
