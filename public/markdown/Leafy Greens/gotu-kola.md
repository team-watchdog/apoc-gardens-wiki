## Description:
Asian Pennywort is a slender perennial plant with creeping stems that root at the node. These generally grow in the tropics. It grows to 10 cm high and spreads to 50 cm across. The stems are creeping and form roots at the nodes while the groups of leaves develop in clumps at the nodes. Leaves are round or heart-shaped with a wavy edge. The edge has teeth or indentations along it. The stems and flowers are dull red or pink. The flowers are small and occur in small clusters. The fruit is round but flattened and 2 mm in diameter.

There are two types of Gotukola based on its growth habit;
1. Bush type
2. Vine Type

There are three types of vine type Gotukola according to the size of leaves;
1. Type with large leaves (Giant Gotukola)
2. Type with medium size leaves (Meerigama selection). This is the most commercially grown Gotukola type and has good taste.
3. Types with small leaves (WelGotukola)

The leaves are eaten raw or cooked. They can be added to tossed salads or steamed and served with rice. They can also be cooked in vegetable soups or stews. The plant is also used for medicine where the leaves are made into tea. The juice of the leaves diluted with water and sweetened with sugar is used as a drink.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Grows year round

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Cuttings or runners are the easiest way to grow plants. Seeds can also be used |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Place a handful of Gotu kola seeds into a bowl of water, and soak it overnight before planting them the next day. Can plant directly on the ground or in a container with proper drainage at the bottom |
| Soil | Well-drained soil are the most suitable for cultivation. It required a soil with a pH range of 6-7. Can add lime or wood ash to help with the pH balance, if necessary. The soil must be adequately prepared before planting Gotu kola seeds, as this plant does not grow well in poor soil conditions. To prepare the soil for first prepare your garden bed by removing all weeds and debris before adding compost or manure to the soil |
| Water | Irrigation is important to maintain the soil moisture. It requires proper watering and drainage to thrive. Water logging should be avoided. If watering frequently, need to have a drainage hole in the container. After planting, make sure to water the area thoroughly. After that, rinse the soil as often as necessary to maintain it uniformly and continuously moist |
| Light | Gotu kola needs a lot of sunlight to grow properly. It should be placed in a sunny spot where it can receive at least six hours of sunlight every day |

### Growing conditions:
| Temperatures | It needs a temperature above 10Â°C |
|----|----|
| Soil | Raised beds or sunken beds should be prepared according to the selected field to facilitate good drainage. Good textured soil with fine filth is more suitable for the growth of deep roots. Both organic and inorganic fertilizers can be applied to the crop. |
| Water | The plant should be watered every day during the dry seasons. The main target here is to keep the soil moist |
| Pruning | Pinch back growing tips to encourage bushier growth |
| Weed control | Hand-pull weeds regularly, especially during the first few weeks after planting |

## Harvesting:
The best time to harvest Gotu Kola is approximately 100 days after planting. This initial harvest can yield a significant amount of leaves, and you can continue to harvest for about 2-3 years thereafter, depending on the plant's health and growth conditions.

You can harvest Gotu Kola whenever the leaves are green and healthy. It's advisable to leave some leaves on the plant to ensure its continued growth and vitality.

## Curing: 
Gotu Kola does not require a curing stage.

## Storage: 
Fresh leaves can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one week.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest Control
**Pest type:**
- Thrips

**Symptoms:**
- **Thrips:** Leaves appear curled and deformed.

**Control method:**
- **Thrips:** Spray neem oil and use insecticide soaps to the underside of infected leaves
  
### Disease Control
**Disease type:** 
- **Brown leaf spot (_Cercospora sp._):** Spread by soil and wind with infected plant parts.
- **Rust Disease (_Uromyces sp._):** Spread by wind and planting materials.
- **Root Rot Disease (_Sclerotium spp._):** Spread through the infected plants or soil.
- **Bacterial Wilt (_Ralstonia solanacearum_):** spread by the infected plants, soil, and irrigation water.
- **Cucumber Mosaic Virus & Poty Virus:** spread by aphids, sap, and cuttings.

**Symptoms:** 
- **Brown leaf spot:** Red or purplish-brown spots appear on the leaves and gradually spread throughout. Eventually, the leaves turn yellow and die.
  
- **Rust Disease:** Rust spots appear on the underside of the leaves. The disease also affects the stems, causing them to become brittle and easily damaged.

- **Root Rot Disease:** Root and stem rot occur in some areas of the gotukola cultivation. The leaves turn yellow, and the plant eventually dries up and dies. White fungal networks can be seen at the base of the plant.
  
- **Bacterial Wilt:** The leaves of infected plants turn brown, rot, and the fruits die. When the base of the infected plant is cut and placed in a glass of water, bacteria can be seen oozing from the cut surface in the form of white smoke.

- **Cucumber Mosaic Virus & Poty Virus:**
  - Yellow-green spots develop on the leaves.
  - Young leaves become irregular in shape, smaller, and turn yellow with brown spots.
  - Leaf edges and stems turn purple.
  - Stunting occurs, and mulching decreases.
  - The plant eventually dies.

**Management:** 
- **Brown leaf spot:**
  - If the disease spreads rapidly, harvest quickly and burn the diseased plant parts.
  - Ensure proper nutrition for cultivation.
  - Avoid unnecessary use of nitrogenous fertilizers.
  - Practice crop rotation.
  - Use healthy planting material for replanting.
    
- **Rust Disease:**
  - If the disease is spreading severely, harvest immediately, remove the diseased plant parts, and burn them.
  - Provide proper nutrition for the crops.
  - Avoid unnecessary application of nitrogenous fertilizers.
  - Follow crop rotation practices.
  - Use healthy planting material for replanting.
    
- **Root Rot Disease:**
  - Avoid overwatering

- **Bacterial Wilt:**
  - No chemical treatments should be used.
  - Immediately remove diseased plants along with the surrounding soil.
  - In paddy fields, avoid diverting water from diseased rows to healthy ones.]
  - Improve irrigation in the field.
  - Use organic fertilizers, especially chicken manure.
  - Control the disease through crop rotation (e.g., sweet potato, kangkung, or mukunuwenna).
  - Use uninfected planting materials for replanting.
    
- **Cucumber Mosaic Virus & Poty Virus:**
  - Remove the diseased plants as soon as they are seen and burn
  - Provide proper nutrition for the cultivation.
  - Avoid unnecessary application of nitrogenous fertilizers
  - Following crop rotation
  - Use healthy planting material for replanting.

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 2/10)
**Explanation:** The warm, humid conditions of the low country wet zone are generally more favorable for Gotu-kola cultivation.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- May require partial shade during the hottest parts of the day
- Need to ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging
- Regular monitoring for fungal diseases due to high humidity

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Gotu-kola can be grown in the low country dry zone with proper irrigation and care.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Requires regular and consistent watering, especially during dry periods
- Mulching is essential to retain soil moisture
- May need shade cloth or partial shade during extreme heat

### Mid country (Difficulty: 3/10)
**Explanation:** The moderate climate of the mid-country provides ideal conditions for Gotu-kola growth.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Minimal adaptations needed
- Regular harvesting to promote continuous growth
- Basic pest and disease monitoring

### Up country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Gotu-kola can be grown in the up country, but cooler temperatures may slow growth.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
