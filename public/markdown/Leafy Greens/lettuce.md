## Description:
Lettuce is most often grown as a leaf vegetable, and used for salads. Lettuce comes in a range of varieties – with flavors from buttery and mild to nutty and even slightly bitter; textures from delicate to crunchy; and colors from pale to dark green and burgundy. Lettuces have a wide range of shapes and textures, from the dense heads of the iceberg type to the notched, scalloped, frilly or ruffly leaves of leaf varieties. 

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>Can be grown year-round in cooler regions of Sri Lanka, best planted during the dry season (May to September) in lowland areas.</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Seed |
|----|----|
| Planting method | <update>Prepare raised beds about 1 m wide, apply well-decomposed organic manure, sow seeds in rows at 10 cm spacing, transplant seedlings after three weeks, space plants 30 cm between rows and 15 cm between plants. In upcountry areas, direct seeding is possible.</update> |
| Soil | <update>Well-drained loamy soil rich in organic matter. pH should be between 6.0 and 7.0. Add lime if soil is too acidic.</update> |
| Water | <update>Water regularly, especially during dry periods. Ensure soil remains moist but not waterlogged.</update> |
| Light | <update>In upcountry areas, full sun is acceptable. In lowland areas, partial shade during the hottest part of the day is beneficial.</update> |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | <update>Optimal growth between 15°C to 20°C. In lowland areas, provide shade or grow during cooler months to prevent bolting.</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | <update>Loose, well-draining soil enriched with organic matter. Maintain pH between 6.0 and 7.0.</update> |
| Water | <update>Regular watering is crucial, especially in dry zones. Mulching helps retain soil moisture. In wet zones, ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging.</update> |
| Pruning | <update>Remove outer leaves as needed for consumption. This promotes continued growth. Remove any yellowing or diseased leaves promptly.</update> |

## Harvesting:
Can be harvested in 50-60 days after transplanting. At harvest, the entire plant can be removed and the roots cut off. At the time of harvesting a well grown plant should weigh about 200 – 400 g. In home gardening, the leaves can be cut separately and used for consumption as required. If cultivated as a single crop, the yield is about 15-17 tons per hectare.

<update>Can be harvested 45-60 days after transplanting, depending on the variety and climate. In home gardens, harvest outer leaves as needed, allowing the plant to continue growing. For commercial production, harvest entire heads when fully mature.</update>

## Curing:
<update>Curing is not typically necessary for lettuce in Sri Lanka. After harvesting, clean the leaves gently and store properly.</update>

## Storage
<update>Store lettuce in a cool, humid place. In areas without refrigeration, wrap in damp cloth and keep in a cool spot. If available, refrigerate at 0°C to 4°C for up to a week.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** <update>Aphids, Caterpillars, Slugs and Snails</update>

**Symptoms:** <update>Holes in leaves, curled or distorted leaves, presence of pests on undersides of leaves</update>

**Control method:**
<update>
- Use neem oil or soap sprays for aphids
- Handpick caterpillars or use Bacillus thuringiensis
- Set up beer traps or use wood ash barriers for slugs and snails
- Maintain field hygiene and remove weeds regularly
</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** <update>Damping off, Downy mildew, Bottom rot</update>

**Symptoms:** <update>Seedling collapse, yellowing leaves with white fuzzy growth, rotting of lower leaves and stems</update>

**Management:**
<update>
- Use well-draining soil and avoid overwatering to prevent damping off
- Ensure good air circulation and avoid overhead watering to manage downy mildew
- Practice crop rotation and maintain proper spacing to prevent bottom rot
- In severe cases, use approved fungicides as per local agricultural recommendations
</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Lettuce cultivation is challenging due to high humidity and temperatures.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Use raised beds for better drainage
- Grow during cooler months or provide shade
- Choose heat-tolerant varieties

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** High temperatures and water scarcity make lettuce cultivation difficult.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Use drip irrigation or mulching to conserve water
- Provide shade during hot periods
- Grow during cooler months

### Mid country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Moderate climate is suitable for lettuce, but pest management is crucial.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Implement integrated pest management
- Use row covers to protect from pests
- Ensure proper spacing for air circulation

### Up country (Difficulty: 3/10)
**Explanation:** Cool climate is ideal for lettuce cultivation.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Protect from occasional frost
- Manage soil moisture during heavy rains
- Choose varieties suited to local conditions
