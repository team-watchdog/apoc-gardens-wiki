## Planting requirements
- Grows in cooler climate/mild climates 
**Planting season:** <update>October to February (Maha season)</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Transplant seedlings |
|----|----|
| Planting method | <update>Start seeds in nursery beds or trays. Transplant seedlings when they are 3 to 4 inches (7-10cm) tall, typically 3-4 weeks after sowing. In cooler areas like Nuwara Eliya, direct sowing is possible.</update> |
| Soil | It requires a soil pH between 6.5 and 6.8. The soil needs to be fertile, well-draining, and non-acidic. These plants are heavy feeders that require plenty of organic matter as well as plenty of nitrogen and lime. So mixing the soil with compost before planting is ideal. |
| Water | Cabbage requires regular, even watering. Uneven watering can result in stunted or cracked heads. |
| Light | <update>Prefers full sun to partial shade, especially in warmer lowland areas.</update> |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | <update>Grows best in temperatures between 15°C to 20°C (59°F to 68°F)</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | Cabbages like deeply dug ground with plenty of humus worked into it. |
| Water | Give cabbage 1 to 1½ inches of water every week. Always water at the base of the plant; avoid over-head watering which can spread disease. |
| Pruning | Remove outer leaves as they become yellow or damaged to encourage inner leaf growth and prevent pests. |
| Weed control | Keep the garden weed-free, especially during early stages of growth. |

## Harvesting:
Can be harvested within 11-15 weeks after planting. <update>In Sri Lanka, harvest when the head is firm and compact, usually 90-120 days after transplanting, depending on the variety and growing conditions.</update> Cut your cabbages at the top of the stem with a sharp knife. Remember to pull both the stem and the root from the ground.

## Curing:
<update>
After harvesting, cure cabbages by removing outer leaves and cutting the base of the stem flat. Store in a cool, humid place for 2-3 weeks before long-term storage. </update>

## Storage
<update>In Sri Lanka's tropical climate, store cabbages in a cool, dry place or in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. For longer storage, consider processing methods like pickling or dehydrating.</update>

**Pest control**
**Pest type:** Cutworms, cabbage loopers (caterpillars preceded by small yellow and white moths), imported cabbage worms, cabbage root maggots, slugs, and aphids.

**Symptoms:**
- Cutworms: Wilting or missing seedlings at the soil line.
- Cabbage loopers: Holes in leaves; presence of greenish-brown caterpillars with a distinctive loop-like movement.
- Imported cabbage worms: Small white butterflies laying eggs on leaves; presence of small, pale green caterpillars with yellow stripes.
- Cabbage root maggots: Wilting plants; yellowing leaves; roots covered in tiny, cream-colored grubs.
- Slugs: Irregular holes in leaves; shiny, soft-bodied pests.
- Aphids: Small, soft-bodied insects that suck sap from leaves and stems; may cause leaf curling or distortion.

**Control method:**
- Cutworms: Place a protecting collar around young plants; use row covers to protect seedlings until they reach 6 inches tall.
- Cabbage loopers & imported cabbage worms: Use floating row covers to prevent moths from laying eggs on leaves. Handpick caterpillars and drop them into soapy water. <update>Apply neem oil or Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) for severe infestations.</update>
- Cabbage root maggots: Mix ash with the soil near the plant to deter grubs; use beneficial nematodes to control grub population.
- Slugs: Handpick and dispose of slugs; use iron phosphate baits or copper tape around plants.
- Aphids: Spray plants with insecticidal soap or neem oil. Introduce ladybugs or lacewings as natural predators.

**Disease Control**
<update>
**Disease type:** Blackleg, clubroot, and black rot.

**Symptoms:**
- Blackleg: Dark spots on leaves that enlarge and turn brown; plant wilts and dies.
- Clubroot: Swollen roots with a distinctive club-like shape; yellowing leaves; stunted growth.
- Black rot: V-shaped, yellow or brown lesions on leaves; black streaks on veins.

**Management:**
- Blackleg & Black rot: Rotate crops annually to prevent disease buildup. Remove infected plants and destroy them. Use fungicides if necessary.
- Clubroot: Rotate crops with non-host plants such as beans, corn, or grasses. Apply lime to raise soil pH. Use resistant cabbage varieties.

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Cabbages are challenging in the wet zone due to high humidity, rainfall, and temperatures, which favor pests and diseases.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Keep garden clean and weed-free to minimize pest habitat.
- Provide adequate spacing between plants for air circulation.
- Use row covers to protect young plants from pests.
- Monitor plants regularly for signs of disease or pests.
- <update>Consider raised beds to improve drainage in high rainfall areas.</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Cabbages can be grown in the dry zone but require consistent watering and protection from heat stress.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure consistent moisture through regular watering.
- Apply mulch to retain soil moisture and suppress weeds.
- Provide some shade during peak heat hours using taller companion plants or structures.
- <update>Choose heat-tolerant varieties suitable for dry zone conditions.</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** <update>The mid-country's moderate temperatures and rainfall make it suitable for cabbage cultivation, but pest management is still crucial.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Monitor soil moisture levels; adjust watering accordingly.
- Protect young plants from strong winds using supports or structures.
- Practice crop rotation to prevent disease buildup.
- <update>Implement integrated pest management techniques to control common pests.</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** <update>The upcountry's cooler temperatures are ideal for cabbage growth, but care is needed to protect from occasional frost and heavy rainfall.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide protection from frost using row covers or cold frames when necessary.
- Choose cold-hardy cabbage varieties suitable for higher elevations.
- Ensure adequate soil drainage to prevent waterlogging during heavy rainfall.
- <update>Time planting to avoid the wettest months to reduce disease pressure.</update>
