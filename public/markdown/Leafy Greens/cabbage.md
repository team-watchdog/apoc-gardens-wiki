## Description:
Cabbage belong to the Brassicaceae (formerly Cruciferae), which is one of the most important families, for it includes the genus Brassica, the cabbage tribe. This contains a great variety of plants, most of which are very good to eat. They come in different colours.

## Planting requirements
- Grows in cooler climate/mild climates. Heat tolerant varieties can be cultivated in dry zone.

**Planting season:** In the up-country year-round. In the low country it is only during October to February (Maha season).

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Transplant seedlings |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Start seeds indoors 4 to 6 weeks and then transplant them in the garden when they are 3 to 4 inches (7-10cm) tall. Directly sow seeds on the ground. Prepare the planting beds ahead of planting by covering beds with 2 to 3 inches (5-7cm) of aged compost and turning it under to 12 inches (30cm) deep. Sow cabbage seeds a ½ inch deep spaced 1 inch (2.5cm) apart. |
| Soil | It requires a soil pH between 6.5 and 6.8. The soil needs to be fertile, well-draining, and non-acidic. These plants are heavy feeders that require plenty of organic matter as well as plenty of nitrogen and lime. So mixing the soil with compost before planting is ideal. |
| Water | Cabbage requires regular, even watering. Uneven watering can result in stunted or cracked heads. |
| Light | Prefers short days with light sunshine and cool temperatures. |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Needs a soil temperatures between 41°F and 64°F |
|----|----|
| Soil | Cabbages like deeply dug ground with plenty of humus worked into it. |
| Water | Give cabbage 1 to 1½ inches of water every week. Always water at the base of the plant; avoid over-head watering which can spread disease. |
| Pruning | Remove outer leaves as they become yellow or damaged to encourage inner leaf growth and prevent pests. |
| Weed control | Keep the garden weed-free, especially during early stages of growth. |

## Harvesting:
Can be harvested within 11-15 weeks after planting. Cut your cabbages at the top of the stem with a sharp knife. Remember to pull both the stem and the root from the ground.

## Curing:
Cabbage does not require curing.

## Storage
In Sri Lanka's tropical climate, store cabbages in a cool, dry place or in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. For longer storage, consider processing methods like pickling or dehydrating.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:**
- Diamond back moth (_Plutella xylostella_)
- Cabbage looper (_Chrysodexis eriosoma_)
- Tobacco cut worm (_Spodoptera litura_)
- Black cut worm (_Agrotis spp_)
- Root maggot (_Delia spp_)
- Aphids
- Slug and Snail

**Symptoms:**
- **Diamond back moth:** The small green larvae feed heavily on leaves, leaving only a thin layer, and in severe cases, they remove all leaf tissue except the veins, affecting cabbage head formation.
- **Cabbage loopers:** Holes in leaves; presence of greenish-brown caterpillars with a distinctive loop-like movement.
- **Tobacco cut worm:** Irregular holes on leaves.
- **Black cut worm:** The nocturnal larvae make holes in leaves early on, but later cut entire plants at the base during emergence, causing wilting during the day.
- **Root maggot:** Wilting leaves and plants shrivel, when pulled up, tiny root maggots can be seen on the roots.
- **Aphids:** They suck sap from the plant, causing leaf malformation and contamination of edible parts.
- **Slug and Snail:** Irregular holes in leaves.

**Control method:**
- **Diamond back moth:** Regular monitoring, crop rotation, and destruction of crop residues. Avoid broad-spectrum pesticides.
- **Cabbage loopers:** proper nursery management, regular field monitoring, crop rotation, and chemical control using the same products as above.
- **Tobacco cut worm:** Proper field sanitation, crop rotation, and protection of natural predators.
- **Black cut worm:** Regular monitoring, hand collection, weed management, deep plowing, and encouraging predatory birds.
- **Root maggot:** Field monitoring, crop rotation, yellow sticky traps, removal of infected plants, and proper compost application.
- **Aphids:** Visual monitoring, weed control, and protection of natural predators.
- **Slug and Snail:** Removal of debris, trapping and hand collection, and encouraging predatory birds.

### Disease Control
**Disease type:**
- Cabbage club root disease
- Cercospora leaf spot
- Black rot
- Head rot
- Cabbage ring spot
- Downey mildew

**Symptoms:**
- **Cabbage club root disease:** lumps or malformations on the roots of the wilting cabbages.
- **Cercospora leaf spot:**
- **Black rot:**
- **Head rot:**
- **Cabbage ring spot:**
- **Downey mildew:**

**Management:**
- **Cabbage club root disease:** Use disease-free planting materials, increase soil pH with lime, rotate crops with non-cruciferous plants, remove weed hosts, and use clean equipment.
- **Cercospora leaf spot:** Field sanitation
- **Black rot:** Use healthy seeds, maintain field sanitation and proper drainage, practice crop rotation, continuously monitor fields, and destroy infected plants.
- **Head rot:** Field sanitation
- **Cabbage ring spot:** Use healthy planting materials, ensure field sanitation, remove alternate host weeds, and maintain proper spacing to avoid overlapping of plants.
- **Downey mildew:** Maintaining field sanitation and weed control.

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Cabbages are challenging in the wet zone due to high humidity, rainfall, and temperatures, which favor pests and diseases.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Keep garden clean and weed-free to minimize pest habitat.
- Provide adequate spacing between plants for air circulation.
- Use row covers to protect young plants from pests.
- Monitor plants regularly for signs of disease or pests.
- Consider raised beds to improve drainage in high rainfall areas.

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Cabbages can be grown in the dry zone but require consistent watering and protection from heat stress.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure consistent moisture through regular watering.
- Apply mulch to retain soil moisture and suppress weeds.
- Provide some shade during peak heat hours using taller companion plants or structures.
- Choose heat-tolerant varieties suitable for dry zone conditions.

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** The mid-country's moderate temperatures and rainfall make it suitable for cabbage cultivation, but pest management is still crucial.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Monitor soil moisture levels; adjust watering accordingly.
- Protect young plants from strong winds using supports or structures.
- Practice crop rotation to prevent disease buildup.
- Implement integrated pest management techniques to control common pests.

### Up country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** The upcountry's cooler temperatures are ideal for cabbage growth, but care is needed to protect from occasional frost and heavy rainfall.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide protection from frost using row covers or cold frames when necessary.
- Choose cold-hardy cabbage varieties suitable for higher elevations.
- Ensure adequate soil drainage to prevent waterlogging during heavy rainfall.
- Time planting to avoid the wettest months to reduce disease pressure.
