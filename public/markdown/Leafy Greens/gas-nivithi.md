## **Description:**
Water leaf or Gas Niwithi is a succulent plant that is native to Sri Lanka, India and several other countries. It is commonly found in home gardens. It can adopt to varying climate conditions. It is an erect perennial herb species with swollen roots and obtuse-angular, hairless, and succulent stems, which can grow to 3–10 feet in height.

## **Planting requirements**
**Planting season:** <update>Best planted at the beginning of the Maha season (October to November) or early Yala season (March to April)</update>

### **Planting conditions:**
| **Propagation** | Make small holes of about 5-7 cm deep on planting beds and insert cuttings or transplant seedlings. |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Transplant seedlings into prepared beds with a spacing of 45-60 cm between plants. |
| Soil | Requires a soil pH of 6.1 to 7.5 for optimal growth. <update>Well-draining red or brown loam soils common in Sri Lanka are ideal.</update> |
| Water | Water regularly, keeping the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. <update>Reduce watering during monsoon seasons to prevent waterlogging.</update>
| Light | Prefers full sun to partial shade. <update>Provide some shade in hot, dry regions like the Northern and Eastern provinces.</update>
| Fertiliser / Mulch | Apply a balanced organic fertilizer once a month during the growing season. Use organic mulch like straw or coconut husk to retain moisture and suppress weeds.

### **Growing conditions:**

| **Temperatures** | Thrives in average temperatures of 20°C to 35°C |
|----|----|
| Soil | Requires well-draining soil with a pH between 6.1 and 7.5. <update>Add compost or aged cow manure to improve soil fertility.</update>
| Water | Water regularly, providing about 2.5 cm of water per week. <update>Adjust watering based on rainfall patterns in different regions of Sri Lanka.</update>
| Pruning | Prune plants periodically to encourage bushier growth and remove dead leaves. <update>Regular pruning helps prevent fungal diseases in humid conditions.</update>
| Weed control | Keep the area around plants weed-free to prevent competition for nutrients and moisture. <update>Use manual weeding methods to avoid chemical residues.</update>

## **Harvesting:**
Can harvest **3 to 4 weeks after planting**

## Curing:
<update>After harvesting, wash leaves thoroughly and dry them in shade. In humid areas, use a well-ventilated area or a low-heat dryer to prevent mold growth.Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.</update> 

## Storage
<update>Store dried leaves in an airtight container away from light and heat for up to six months. In high humidity areas, add silica gel packets to the container to absorb excess moisture.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### **Pest control**
**Pest type:** Fowl, lizard, squirrel, and caterpillar
**Symptoms:** Holes in leaves, wilting, or yellowing of leaves
**Control method:** Cover the ground with nets, use scarecrows or insecticides to remove caterpillars

### **Disease Control**
<update>
**Disease type:** Root rot, leaf spot
**Symptoms:** Wilting, yellowing leaves, and black spots on leaves for leaf spot; water-soaked appearance at the base of plants for root rot.
**Management:** Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. Remove infected leaves promptly to control leaf spot. Apply copper-based fungicides if necessary, following local agricultural guidelines.</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Gas Nivithi can be challenging in the wet zone due to high rainfall, which can increase the risk of root rot and fungal diseases.
- **Challenges/Adaptations:**
    - Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging. <update>Consider raised beds or mounds to improve drainage. Use disease-resistant varieties when available.</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Gas Nivithi is relatively easy to grow in the dry zone with adequate irrigation.
- **Challenges/Adaptations:**
    - Provide consistent moisture during the dry season. <update>Use drip irrigation or mulching to conserve water. Consider shade cloth during extreme heat.</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Gas Nivithi can be moderately challenging in the mid-country due to varying temperatures and rainfall.
- **Challenges/Adaptations:**
    - Ensure consistent moisture during the dry season. <update>Use terracing techniques on sloped land to prevent soil erosion and retain moisture.</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Gas Nivithi can be challenging in the up-country due to cooler temperatures and potential frost.
- **Challenges/Adaptations:**
    - Provide protection from frost, such as covering plants with plastic or straw mulch. <update>Consider greenhouse cultivation or use of polytunnels during colder months. Choose sheltered planting locations.</update>
