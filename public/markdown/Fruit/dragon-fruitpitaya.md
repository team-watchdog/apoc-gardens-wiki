## Description:
A pitaya is the fruit of several different cactus species indigenous to the region of southern Mexico and along the Pacific coasts of Guatemala, Costa Rica, and El Salvador. Pitaya is cultivated in East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the United States, the Caribbean, Australia, and throughout tropical and subtropical regions of the world. 

Pitaya usually refers to fruit of the genus Stenocereus, while pitahaya or dragon fruit refers to fruit of the genus Selenicereus (formerly Hylocereus), both in the family Cactaceae. The common name in English – dragon fruit – derives from the leather-like skin and scaly spikes on the fruit exterior. Depending on the variety, pitaya fruits may have sweet- or sour-tasting flesh that can be red, white, or yellow in color. 

Selenicereus has adapted to live in dry tropical climates with a moderate amount of rain. In numerous regions, it has escaped cultivation to become a weed and is classified as an invasive weed in some countries.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>Year-round in Sri Lanka, with peak planting during the dry season (May to September)</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation**     | Direct seeding, stem cuttings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **Planting method** | Cuttings should be taken from selected mother plants which are bearing fruits. Cuttings should be 15-20 centimetres in length and stored in a dry place for 1-2 days before planting. Cuttings should be planted in pots which are filled with a well-drained potting mix. For the potting mix, a mixture of dried cow dung, topsoil, and sand in a 1:1:2 ratio is optimal. To ensure cuttings take root, the pots should be kept at normal wet conditions and under shading. After the growth of shoots, stem cuttings are trained for the environment and then used for planting on posts. |
| **Soil**            | Well-drained soil is necessary for dragon fruit cultivation. The plant is highly responsive to organic matter, and 10-30% sand level is favorable. The plant grows well in sandy soil.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|                     | In Sri Lanka, red-yellow podzolic soils and reddish-brown earths are suitable for dragon fruit cultivation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Water**           | Adequate irrigation must be provided, especially in dry conditions. In Sri Lanka's dry zone, drip irrigation is recommended for efficient water use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Light**           | Full or partial sunlight. In Sri Lanka, providing some afternoon shade in extremely hot areas can be beneficial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

### Growing conditions:
As the plant creeps upwards along the supportive structure, 5-6 ft high concrete or wooden posts should be placed closer to the plant. Upward growth of the plant should be facilitated by tightening the growing stem to the post. Aerial roots develop on the stem, binding the stem tightly to the post. The lateral shoots that develop on an upward growing stem should be limited and 2-3 main stems should be allowed to grow. Lateral shoots should be removed time to time.

| **Temperatures** | 20-30 degrees celsius <update>(suitable for most of Sri Lanka's climate zones)</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | Well drained soil is necessary for dragon fruit cultivation. Plant is highly responsive to organic matter and 10-30% sand level is favourable. Plant is well grown in sandy soil. |
| Water | Irrigation is required during the dry season. In the dry zone an irrigation system should be established. <update>In Sri Lanka's wet zone, ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging.</update> |
| Pruning | Prune plants annually after fruiting to maintain shape and encourage new growth. <update>In Sri Lanka, more frequent pruning may be necessary due to faster growth rates in tropical conditions.</update> |
| Weed control | Keep the area around the plant free of weeds to prevent competition for nutrients and water. <update>Manual weeding is preferred in Sri Lanka to minimize chemical use.</update> |

## Harvesting:
Fruits mature 40-50 days after appearance of flower buds or 30-35 days after blooming of flowers. The fruiting period will continue up to November and during this period harvesting can be done 5-6 times. <update>In Sri Lanka, with proper management, dragon fruit can be harvested year-round, with peak production from July to October.</update>

## Curing:
<update>Allow fruits to ripen on the plant before harvesting. Cure at room temperature for a few days to allow the skin to toughen.</update>

## Storage
<update>Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks or at room temperature for up to 5 days. In Sri Lanka's hot climate, refrigeration is recommended to extend shelf life.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Fruit flies, Stem rot, brown patches

**Symptoms:** <update>Fruit flies cause small holes in fruit. Stem rot appears as dark spots on the stem that can spread. Brown patches appear on leaves and stems.</update>

**Control method:** Organic insecticides are effective at pest control. To prevent stem rot and brown patches, ensure there is adequate spacing between plants. Remove unnecessary shoots. Avoid over-watering especially during the rainy season. <update>In Sri Lanka, using neem-based pesticides and pheromone traps for fruit flies is common and environmentally friendly.</update>

### Disease Control
<update>
**Disease type:** Root rot

**Symptoms:** Wilting leaves, yellowing of leaves, and blackening of roots.

**Management:** Avoid overwatering and ensure good drainage. Use fungicides if necessary. In Sri Lanka's high humidity conditions, copper-based fungicides are often used as a preventive measure.</update>

## Difficulty Rating
