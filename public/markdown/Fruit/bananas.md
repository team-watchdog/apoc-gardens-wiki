## Description:
Bananas can be classed into diploid, triploid, and tetraploid kinds with various amounts of the A or B parents. They grow 2-9 m high. They are large non-woody herbs with broad long leaves. Most kinds have several suckers. Bananas grow a soft firm false stem from an underground corm. The fruiting stalk eventually emerges from the top of this false stem and normally curves over pointing towards the ground.

#### Recommended Varieties for Sri Lanka
- Nadee River (Embul-AAB): High-quality sour banana, light green stem, large cans (about 15 kg).
- Kandula (Dual Purpose-AABB): Quadruple hybrid, can be used as fruit and vegetable, dark purple to black stem, drought and wind resistant.
- Pulathisi (Cooking banana-ABBB): Quadruple hybrid, drought and wind resistant, suitable for vegetables and products.
- Prasad (Ash plantain-ABB): Local gray banana selection, suitable for both dry and wet zones.
- Agra (Kolikuttu-AAB): High-quality Kolikuttu selection, good yield in dry zone under irrigation.

Other varieties grown in Sri Lanka include Ambon (AAA), Anamalu (AAA), Mondan (ABB), Kitala (ABB), Atamuru (ABB), and Bing Banana (AAA).

## Planting requirements
- Ideal for warm and humid climates of Sri Lanka
- Can be grown successfully from sea level to 1500 meters altitude
  
**Planting season:** February - March, October - November

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Young plant suckers |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Suckers are usually put 30 cm deep |
| Soil | Requires a soil pH between 5.5 - 6.5 and fertile soil with good drainage |
| Water | Bananas require a large amount of water for healthy growth. Needs a moist soil that drains well |
| Light | Requires full sunlight |

### Growing conditions:

| Temperatures | Best temperature range is 15°C - 38°C, with 27°C being optimal |
|----|----|
| Soil | Bananas are heavy feeders and therefore respond well to manure.  |
| Water | Require watering every day but avoid waterlogging. Watering from a garden hose or drip irrigation is best |
| Pruning | Prune the plant after harvesting to encourage new growth.
| Weed control | Keep the area around the plants weed-free to prevent competition for nutrients and water

## Harvesting:
The ideal time for harvesting is 12 weeks from flowering and should be done in the morning or evening.

## Curing: 
Bananas are cured after harvesting by hanging them in a dark, humid place for about a week to allow the flavors to develop.

## Storage: 
Store bananas at room temperature away from direct sunlight. They can also be frozen or dried for later use.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:**
- Weevils
- Thrips
- Nematodes
- Scarring beetles
- Sap-sucking insects

**Symptoms:** 
- Wilting leaves
- Yellowing leaves
- Holes in leaves and fruits

**Control method:** 
- Use insecticides
- Remove the affected plants
- Remove weeds
- Spray soapy water
- Release ladybird beetles and lacewings in the field which are very active aphid feeders

### Disease Control
**Disease type:**
- Panama disease (_Fusarium ocdysporum_)
- Anthracnose (_colletortichum  spp_)
- Black Sigatoka leaf spot disease (_Mycosphorella fijiensis_)
- Kodana leaf spot disease (_Codana musqe_)

**Symptoms:** 
- **Panama disease:**
  - All varieties except sour varieties are susceptible to Panama disease.
  - Brown discoloration in pseudostem and corm, wilting, yellowing leaves
  - Wilting occurs due to impaired water absorption, causing the leaves to yellow, fall from the petiole, and eventually lead to plant death.
  - Symptoms often appear on bushes near developing banana canes, while smaller plants may not show symptoms.
  
- **Anthracnose:**
  - Among the banana varieties grown in Sri Lanka, the gray banana is the most susceptible to this disease.
  - In other cultivated banana varieties, black circular spots may form during fruit ripening, appearing as clusters of black spots, a condition that occurs post-harvest.
    
- **Black Sigatoka:**
  - Dark brown spots run parallel to the lateral veins, appearing on the upper leaves (typically 2nd to 4th sheets).
  - This disease is more economically damaging than Kahasigatoka leaf disease, potentially reducing yields by 35-50%. All cultivated banana varieties are susceptible.
  - A minimum of 5 healthy, productive leaves is crucial for yield. This disease can significantly affect yield, causing premature fruit ripening and uneven ripening.

- **Kodana leaf spot:**
  - Oval spots form on the leaf blade and spread toward both leaf margins.
  - These spots have a brown-gray center with a concentric ring-like pattern and are surrounded by a bright yellow halo.

Black spots on leaves, yellowing of leaves, stunted growth
**Management:**
- **Panama disease:**
  - Fungicides are ineffective for disease control, so prevention is key.
  - Water regularly and avoid disposing of diseased plant parts into waterways.
  - Practice crop rotation with resistant varieties like sour.
  - Obtain planting material from healthy mother plants.
  - Reduce soil acidity, as acidic conditions increase pathogen density, by applying dolomite or fly ash.
  - Tissue-cultured plants can be used as healthy planting material but may still be affected if planted in infected fields.

- **Anthracnose:**
  - Proper field hygiene should be maintained by removing weeds and keeping the plantation clean.
  - For gray plantains, apply a fungicide containing mancozeb or chlorothalonil at 2-week intervals after bud break.
  - It is also recommended that the banana bunch be covered.
    
- **Black Sigatoka:** If symptoms are present, the plants should be removed.
  
- **Kodana leaf spot:** Infected leaves should be cut off and burned.

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Bananas grow well in the warm, humid conditions of the low country wet zone.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Requires regular watering to prevent wilting
- Susceptible to Black Sigatoka disease

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Bananas can be grown in the low country dry zone with adequate irrigation.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Requires more watering than other plants due to high transpiration rate
- Needs protection from strong winds
- Best varieties to grow: Kolikuttu, Embul (Sour), Seeni (Sugar Banana), Kandula

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** The moderate climate of the midcountry is suitable for banana cultivation.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Requires regular pruning to encourage fruit production
- Susceptible to pests and diseases
- Best varieties to grow: Kolikuttu, Embul (Sour), Seeni (Sugar Banana), Kandula, Anamalu, Ambon, Rath Banana (Red Banana), Nethrampalam

### Up country (Difficulty: 8/10)
**Explanation:** Bananas can be grown in the upcountry with careful management of temperature and water requirements.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Requires protection from frost
- Needs regular watering to prevent wilting due to high-altitude temperatures
- - Best varieties to grow: Embul (Sour), Seeni (Sugar Banana), Kandula, Anamalu, Ambon, Rath Banana (Red Banana), Nethrampalam, Suwandel, Puwalu, Bing Banana
