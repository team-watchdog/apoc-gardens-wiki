## Description:
Bananas can be classed into diploid, triploid, and tetraploid kinds with various amounts of the A or B parents. They grow 6.5 - 30 feet (2-9 m) high. They are large non-woody herbs with broad long leaves. Most kinds have several suckers. Bananas grow a soft firm false stem from an underground corm. The fruiting stalk eventually emerges from the top of this false stem and normally curves over pointing towards the ground.

**Recommended Varieties for Sri Lanka:**
- Nadee River (Embul-AAB): High-quality sour banana, light green stem, large cans (about 15 kg).
- Kandula (Dual Purpose-AABB): Quadruple hybrid, can be used as fruit and vegetable, dark purple to black stem, drought and wind resistant.
- Pulathisi (Cooking banana-ABBB): Quadruple hybrid, drought and wind resistant, suitable for vegetables and products.
- Prasad (Ash plantain-ABB): Local gray banana selection, suitable for both dry and wet zones.
- Agra (Kolikuttu-AAB): High-quality Kolikuttu selection, good yield in dry zone under irrigation.
- Parakum (Seeni Kesel-ABB): High-quality sugar banana selection.
-  Millewa Suwandel (Suwandel-AAB): Quality fragrant banana, suitable for wet zone.
- Gannoruwa Seeni 1 (Seeni Kesel-ABB): Superior quality sugar banana, resistant to Panama disease.
- Gannoruwa red banana (Rath Kesael-AAB): Extra large cans, superior quality and taste.

Other varieties grown in Sri Lanka include Ambon (AAA), Anamalu (AAA), Mondan (ABB), Kitala (ABB), Atamuru (ABB), and Bing Banana (AAA).

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** February to March and October to November

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Young plant suckers |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Suckers are usually put 30 cm deep |
| Soil | Requires a soil pH between 5.5 - 6.5 and fertile soil with good drainage |
| Water | Bananas require a large amount of water for healthy growth. Needs a moist soil that drains well |
| Light | Requires full sunlight |

### Growing conditions:

| Temperatures | Best temperature range is 15°C - 38°C, with 27°C being optimal |
|----|----|
| Soil | Bananas are heavy feeders and therefore respond well to manure.  |
| Water | Require watering every day but avoid waterlogging. Watering from a garden hose or drip irrigation is best |
| Pruning | Prune the plant after harvesting to encourage new growth.
| Weed control | Keep the area around the plants weed-free to prevent competition for nutrients and water

## Harvesting:
The ideal time for harvesting is 12 weeks from flowering and should be done in the morning or evening.

## Curing: 
Bananas are cured after harvesting by hanging them in a dark, humid place for about a week to allow the flavors to develop.

## Storage: 
Store bananas at room temperature away from direct sunlight. They can also be frozen or dried for later use.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest Control
**Pest type:**
- Banana Weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus)
- Stem Weevil (Odoiporus longicollis)
- Banana Aphid (Pentalonia nigronervosa)
- Banana Rust Thrips (Chaetanaphothrips signipennis)
- Nematodes (e.g., Radopholus similis)

**Symptoms:**
- **Banana Weevil:** Wilting and yellowing of leaves; holes in the pseudostem with jelly-like sap oozing out
- **Stem Weevil:** Damage to the pseudostem, causing weakening and potential collapse
- **Banana Aphid:** Yellowing of leaves and stunted growth due to sap-sucking
- **Banana Rust Thrips:** Staining and splitting of the banana peel, leading to rotting flesh
- **Nematodes:** Corm rot, yellowing leaves, and reduced growth

**Control method:**
- **Banana Weevil:** Use of chemical insecticides; biological control options like Piaesius javanus (limited effectiveness)
- **Stem Weevil:** Insecticides specifically targeting weevils; remove infested plants
- **Banana Aphid:** Insecticidal sprays; maintain plant health to reduce susceptibility
- **Banana Rust Thrips:** Apply insecticidal dust or sprays; use polyethylene bagging for young fruit
- **Nematodes:** Apply nematicides; implement soil management practices such as fallowing and solarization

### Disease Control
**Disease type:**
- Panama disease (Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense)
- Anthracnose (Colletotrichum spp.)
- Black Sigatoka leaf spot disease (Mycosphaerella fijiensis)
- Kodana leaf spot disease (Cordana musae)
- Banana Bunchy Top Virus (BBTV)
- Moko Disease (Ralstonia solanacearum)
- Banana Bract Mosaic Virus

**Symptoms:**
- **Panama disease:** Brown discoloration in pseudostem and corm, wilting, yellowing leaves; internal vascular discoloration
- **Anthracnose:** Black circular spots on fruit during ripening, appearing as clusters of black spots post-harvest
- **Black Sigatoka:** Dark brown spots parallel to lateral veins on upper leaves; can reduce yields by 35-50%
- **Kodana leaf spot:** Oval spots on leaf blade with brown-gray center, concentric ring pattern, and yellow halo
- **Banana Bunchy Top Virus:** Stunted growth, yellow mottling on leaves, and malformed bunches
- **Moko Disease:** Yellowing and wilting of young leaves; internal vascular discoloration leading to plant death
- **Banana Bract Mosaic Virus:** Greenish-yellow streaks on leaves that turn necrotic; mottling on pseudostems

**Management:**
- **Panama disease:** 
  - Practice prevention: water regularly, avoid disposing diseased parts in waterways
  - Crop rotation with resistant varieties
  - Use healthy planting material
  - Reduce soil acidity with dolomite or fly ash
  - Quarantine measures; field flooding
- **Anthracnose:** 
  - Maintain field hygiene
  - Apply fungicides containing mancozeb or chlorothalonil for susceptible varieties
  - Cover banana bunches
- **Black Sigatoka:** 
  - Remove infected plants
  - Regular fungicide applications
  - Use resistant cultivars when available
- **Kodana leaf spot:** Cut off and burn infected leaves
- **Banana Bunchy Top Virus:** 
  - Remove infected plants
  - Control aphid populations
- **Moko Disease:** 
  - Implement quarantine measures
  - Destroy infected plants
- **Banana Bract Mosaic Virus:** 
  - Use disease-free planting materials
  - Control vectors through insecticides

General practices:
- Obtain planting material from healthy mother plants or use tissue-cultured plants
- Maintain proper field hygiene and remove weeds
- Practice crop rotation when possible
- Use resistant varieties when available
- Implement quarantine measures for new plantings

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Bananas grow well in the warm, humid conditions of the low country wet zone.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**

- Susceptible to Black Sigatoka disease

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Bananas can be grown in the low country dry zone with adequate irrigation.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Requires more watering than other plants due to high transpiration rate
- Needs protection from strong winds
- Best varieties to grow: Kolikuttu, Embul (Sour), Seeni (Sugar Banana), Kandula

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** The moderate climate of the midcountry is suitable for banana cultivation.
