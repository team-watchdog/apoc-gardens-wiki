## Description:
Pitaya usually refers to the fruit of the genus Stenocereus, while pitahaya or dragon fruit refers to fruit of the genus Selenicereus (formerly Hylocereus), both in the family Cactaceae. The common name in English – dragon fruit – derives from the leather-like skin and scaly spikes on the fruit exterior. Depending on the variety, pitaya fruits may have sweet- or sour-tasting flesh that can be red, white, or yellow. 

Selenicereus has adapted to live in dry tropical climates with a moderate amount of rain. In numerous regions, it has escaped cultivation to become a weed and is classified as an invasive weed in some countries.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Grows year-round in Sri Lanka.

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Direct seeding, stem cuttings |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Take 15-20 cm cuttings from fruiting mother plants. Store them in a dry place for 1-2 days before planting in well-drained pots with a 1:1:2 mix of dried cow dung, topsoil, and sand. Keep pots shaded and moist until shoots grow, then acclimate cuttings before planting on posts |
| Soil | Well-drained soil is necessary for dragon fruit cultivation. The plant is highly responsive to organic matter, and 10-30% sand level is favorable. The plant grows well in sandy soil |
| Water | Adequate irrigation must be provided, especially in dry conditions. In Sri Lanka's dry zone, drip irrigation is recommended for efficient water use |
| Light | Full or partial sunlight |

### Growing conditions:
As the plant creeps upwards along the supportive structure, 5-6 ft high concrete or wooden posts should be placed closer to the plant. Upward growth of the plant should be facilitated by tightening the growing stem to the post. Aerial roots develop on the stem, binding the stem tightly to the post. The lateral shoots that develop on an upward growing stem should be limited and 2-3 main stems should be allowed to grow. Lateral shoots should be removed time to time.

| Temperatures | 20-30°C |
|----|----|
| Soil | Well-drained soil is necessary for dragon fruit cultivation. The plant is highly responsive to organic matter and 10-30% sand level is favourable. The plant is well-grown in sandy soil |
| Water | Irrigation is required during the dry season. In the dry zone, an irrigation system should be established |
| Pruning | Prune plants annually after fruiting to maintain shape and encourage new growth |
| Weed control | Keep the area around the plant free of weeds to prevent competition for nutrients and water |

## Harvesting:
Fruits mature 40-50 days after the appearance of flower buds or 30-35 days after blooming of flowers. The fruiting period will continue up to November and during this period harvesting can be done 5-6 times.

## Curing:
Dragon fruit does not require a curing stage.

## Storage
The fruit can be stored for about 40 days at 5°C and 90% relative humidity (RH). Storing at high temperatures rapidly reduces fruit quality.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:**
- Fruit fly
- Stem rot
- Brown patches

**Symptoms:**
- **Fruit fly:** Fruits can be damaged by the attack of fruit fly.
  
- **Stem rot:** At the first stage brownish, oval shaped, moderately sunken lesions/patches appear on thorny ribs of the stem. Gradually those lesions combine together, turn yellow, and then rot spreads along the edges.
  
- **Brown patches:** Small, yellowish, moderately sunken spots appear on the stem. Gradually it becomes larger spots and turns to red and then brown. Subsequently, the stem starts to rot and finally damaged areas become thicker walled lesions.

**Control method:**
- **Fruit fly:** Cover fruits, bury infected fruits about 2ft deep or remove infected fruits by covering with black polythene bags, use protein traps, use pheromone traps (Methyl Euginol).
  
- **Stem rot:** Use fungicides recommended for controlling Anthracnose in other cultivations (Manab, Mancozab, Carbendazim).
  
- **Brown patches:** Remove and destroy infected parts. Do not use diseased plants for propagation.

### Disease Control
**Disease type:**
- Anthracnose
- Stem canker

**Symptoms:**
- **Anthracnose:** Brownish, oval-shaped, moderately sunken lesions/patches appear on thorny ribs of the stem. Lesions combine, turn yellow, and rot spreads along the edges.
  
- **Stem canker:** Small (1mm), yellowish, moderately sunken spots appear on the stem, growing to 4mm. Spots turn red then brown. Stem starts to rot, damaged areas become thicker-walled lesions. Can also damage fruits.

**Management:**
- **Anthracnose:** Use fungicides recommended for controlling Anthracnose in other cultivations (Manab, Mancozab, Carbendazim).
  
- **Stem canker:** Remove and destroy infected parts. Do not use diseased plants for propagation.

**For all diseases:**
- Plant with proper spacing
- Remove unnecessary shoots
- Avoid over-irrigation
- Maintain proper drainage in the rainy season

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Dragon fruit requires consistent moisture, but is prone to root rot in waterlogged conditions. The high humidity can also encourage fungal diseases.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Regular monitoring for root rot and fungal diseases is necessary.
- Ensure good drainage and avoid overhead irrigation.
- Use raised beds or mounds to improve drainage if soil is heavy.
- Implement proper pruning to improve air circulation.

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Dragon fruit tolerates drought once established, but fruit production may decrease in prolonged dry periods. The hot temperatures can also stress the plant.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Implement deep watering during fruiting season to maintain productivity.
- Provide shade during extreme heat, especially for young plants.
- Use mulch to retain soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.
- Consider drip irrigation for efficient water use.

### Mid country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Dragon fruit requires consistent moisture and protection from strong winds. The cooler temperatures at higher elevations may affect fruit production.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide windbreaks to protect plants from strong winds.
- Ensure adequate water supply, especially during dry spells.
- Maintain warmer microclimate if possible to encourage fruit production.
- Use trellises or support structures to maximize sun exposure.

### Up country (Difficulty: 9/10)
**Explanation:** Dragon fruit is not well suited to high elevations due to cold temperatures. Frost can damage the plant and flowers, reducing fruit production.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Grow in a protected location with a warmer microclimate.
- Use row covers or greenhouses during cold periods.
- Consider using heat-trapping techniques like mulching or plastic covers.
- Focus on cold-tolerant varieties if attempting to grow in this zone.
- Be prepared for reduced yield and possible crop failure in harsh winters.
