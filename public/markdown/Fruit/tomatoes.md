## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>October to December (Maha season) and April to May (Yala season)</update>

#### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Seeds |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Grow in seed trays, plant out in 4-6 weeks. Sow seed at a depth approximately three times the diameter of the seed.<update>Ensure seeds are planted at least 1/2 inch deep. In Sri Lanka, direct seeding is also common in some areas.</update> |
| Soil | Requires rich soil with pH between 6.5 to 7. Harrow the soil and break it finely. Mix organic matter/compost prior to planting. Good drainage is essential<update>In Sri Lanka, well-draining loamy soils are ideal. Add coconut husk or rice hull ash to improve drainage in heavy soils.</update> |
| Water | Don't water too much; keep the soil slightly on the dry side—just dry-to-moist.<update>In Sri Lanka's climate, water seeds daily but lightly until germination, especially during dry spells.</update> |
| Light | Need plenty of sunshine (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight) but do not like humidity<update>In Sri Lanka, provide partial shade during the hottest part of the day, especially in lowland areas.</update> |

#### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Requires soil temperature of 70°F (21°C) for germination<update>Tomatoes grow well in Sri Lanka's tropical climate. In cooler upcountry areas, use plastic mulch to warm the soil.</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | Better to add 5 to 7cm of mulch throughout the plants to ensure soil remains moist. Organic material such as shredded bark and chopped leaves will make the soil better as they crumble<update>In Sri Lanka, use locally available mulch materials like paddy straw or coconut fronds. This helps conserve moisture during dry spells.</update> |
| Water | Water plants daily or at least every other day to maintain sufficient soil moisture<update>In Sri Lanka's hot climate, water deeply 2-3 times a week. Use drip irrigation if possible to conserve water.</update> |
| Pruning | <update>Remove lower leaves and suckers to improve air circulation, which is crucial in Sri Lanka's humid climate to prevent fungal diseases.</update> |
| Weed control | Keep surrounding area around the plant free from weed<update>Manual weeding is common in Sri Lanka. Apply organic mulch to suppress weed growth.</update> |

## Harvesting:
Can be harvested after 8-17 weeks<update>In Sri Lanka, tomatoes are typically ready for harvest 60-80 days after transplanting, depending on the variety and climate conditions.</update>

## Curing:
<update>Curing is not necessary for ripe tomatoes. For green tomatoes harvested before monsoon rains, store in a cool, dry place to ripen gradually.</update>

## Storage
<update>In Sri Lanka's hot climate, store ripe tomatoes in a cool, shaded area. Use within 3-5 days for best quality. Avoid refrigeration as it affects flavor.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Aphids, Cutworms, Hornworms, Whiteflies, Flea beetles<update>, Fruit borer (Helicoverpa armigera)</update>

**Symptoms:** <update>Look for holes in fruits, wilting plants, curled or yellowing leaves, and presence of pests on undersides of leaves.</update>

**Control method:**
- Spray insecticides<update>Use neem oil or pyrethrum-based sprays, which are locally available and effective against many pests in Sri Lanka.</update>
- Sprinkle wood ash around the plant<update>This traditional method is still used by some Sri Lankan farmers to deter certain pests.</update>
- Keep surrounding area around the plant free from weed<update>Practice crop rotation and intercropping with marigolds or basil, which are common in Sri Lankan home gardens and help repel pests.</update>

### Disease Control
<update>Common diseases in Sri Lanka include early blight, late blight, and bacterial wilt. Practice crop rotation, use disease-resistant varieties, and ensure good drainage. Apply copper-based fungicides in severe cases, following local agricultural extension recommendations.</update>

## Difficulty Rating

### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Tomatoes require consistent moisture and warmth, which can be challenging in the wet zone's humid conditions.<update>High humidity and frequent rains in this zone increase the risk of fungal diseases. Proper drainage and disease management are crucial.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide adequate drainage
- Ensure good air circulation around plants
- Monitor for and manage fungal diseases
<update>- Use raised beds or container gardening
- Choose disease-resistant varieties suitable for wet conditions</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Tomatoes need consistent watering, which can be difficult in the dry zone's low rainfall conditions.<update>Water scarcity can be a major challenge, especially during prolonged dry spells.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide adequate watering
- Apply mulch to retain soil moisture
- Monitor for and manage heat stress
<update>- Implement water-efficient irrigation methods like drip irrigation
- Use drought-tolerant varieties</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Tomatoes prefer consistent temperatures, which can vary in the mid country's fluctuating climate.<update>The mid country's moderate climate is generally suitable for tomato cultivation, but pest management can be challenging.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide some shade during peak hours
- Monitor for and manage temperature extremes
<update>- Implement integrated pest management practices
- Use trellising to improve air circulation</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Tomatoes are not frost-tolerant, making them challenging to grow in the upcountry's cooler temperatures.<update>While frost is rare in Sri Lanka's upcountry, cooler temperatures can slow growth and extend the cultivation period.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide frost protection
- Choose heat-tolerant varieties suitable for higher elevations
- Extend the growing season using row covers or greenhouses
<update>- Use plastic mulch to warm the soil
- Select short-duration varieties adapted to cooler climates</update>
