## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** October to December (Maha season) and April to May (Yala season)

#### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Seeds |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Grow in seed trays, plant out in 4-6 weeks. Sow seed at a depth approximately three times the diameter of the seed. Ensure seeds are planted at least 1/2 inch deep. In Sri Lanka, direct seeding is also common in some areas. |
| Soil | Requires rich soil with pH between 6.5 to 7. Harrow the soil and break it finely. Mix organic matter/compost prior to planting. Good drainage is essential. In Sri Lanka, well-draining loamy soils are ideal. Add coconut husk or rice hull ash to improve drainage in heavy soils. |
| Water | Don't water too much; keep the soil slightly on the dry side—just dry-to-moist. In Sri Lanka's climate, water seeds daily but lightly until germination, especially during dry spells. |
| Light | Need plenty of sunshine (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight) but do not like humidity. In Sri Lanka, provide partial shade during the hottest part of the day, especially in lowland areas. |

#### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Requires soil temperature of 70°F (21°C) for germination. Tomatoes grow well in Sri Lanka's tropical climate. In cooler upcountry areas, use plastic mulch to warm the soil. |
|----|----|
| Soil | Better to add 5 to 7cm of mulch throughout the plants to ensure soil remains moist. Organic material such as shredded bark and chopped leaves will make the soil better as they crumble. In Sri Lanka, use locally available mulch materials like paddy straw or coconut fronds. This helps conserve moisture during dry spells. |
| Water | Water plants daily or at least every other day to maintain sufficient soil moisture. In Sri Lanka's hot climate, water deeply 2-3 times a week. Use drip irrigation if possible to conserve water. |
| Pruning | Remove lower leaves and suckers to improve air circulation, which is crucial in Sri Lanka's humid climate to prevent fungal diseases. |
| Weed control | Keep surrounding area around the plant free from weed. Manual weeding is common in Sri Lanka. Apply organic mulch to suppress weed growth. |

## Harvesting:
In Sri Lanka, tomatoes are typically ready for harvest 60-80 days after transplanting, depending on the variety and climate conditions.

## Curing:
Curing is not necessary for ripe tomatoes. For green tomatoes harvested before monsoon rains, store in a cool, dry place to ripen gradually.

## Storage
In Sri Lanka's hot climate, store ripe tomatoes in a cool, shaded area. Use within 3-5 days for best quality. Avoid refrigeration as it affects flavor.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Aphids, Cutworms, Hornworms, Whiteflies, Flea beetles, Fruit borer (Helicoverpa armigera)

**Symptoms:** Look for holes in fruits, wilting plants, curled or yellowing leaves, and presence of pests on undersides of leaves.

**Control method:**
- Spray insecticides. Use neem oil or pyrethrum-based sprays, which are locally available and effective against many pests in Sri Lanka.
- Sprinkle wood ash around the plant. This traditional method is still used by some Sri Lankan farmers to deter certain pests.
- Keep surrounding area around the plant free from weed. Practice crop rotation and intercropping with marigolds or basil, which are common in Sri Lankan home gardens and help repel pests.

### Disease Control
Common diseases in Sri Lanka include early blight, late blight, and bacterial wilt. Practice crop rotation, use disease-resistant varieties, and ensure good drainage. Apply copper-based fungicides in severe cases, following local agricultural extension recommendations.
