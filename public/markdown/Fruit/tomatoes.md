## Description:
TIn addition to being an important flavour enhancer in variety of dishes, Tomatoes are a rich source of vitamin A and C along with various minerals and B vitamins. The studies have shown that a diet rich in tomatoes is protective against a variety of cancers, including prostate and pancreatic. Other studies have shown that important antioxidants in tomatoes, such as lycopene, are present in greater quantities when the tomatoes are raised organically, so growing your own tomatoes would be an advantage. There are several varieties of tomatoes.

## Planting requirements
- Can be grown in any zone except wet zone
**Planting season:** Mid March, End April

#### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Seeds                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Planting method | Grow in seed trays, plant out in 4-6 weeks. Sow seed at a depth approximately three times the diameter of the seed.                                                                                    |
| Soil            | Requires rich soil with pH between 6.5 to 7. Harrow the soil and break it finely. Mix organic matter/compost prior to planting. Good drainage is essential                                             |
| Water           | Don't water too much; keep the soil slightly on the dry side—just dry-to-moist.<update>In Sri Lanka's climate, water seeds daily but lightly until germination, especially during dry spells.</update> |
| Light           | Need plenty of sunshine (at least 6 hours of direct sunlight) but do not like humidity                                                                                                                 |

#### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Requires soil temperature of 70°F (21°C).                                                                                                                                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Soil             | Better to add 5 to 7cm of mulch throughout the plants to ensure soil remains moist. Organic material such as shredded bark and chopped leaves will make the soil better as they crumble |
| Water            | Water plants daily or at least every other day to maintain sufficient soil moisture                                                                                                     |
| Pruning          | <update>Remove lower leaves and suckers to improve air circulation, which is crucial in Sri Lanka's humid climate to prevent fungal diseases.</update>                                  |
| Weed control     | Keep surrounding area around the plant free from weed.                                                                                                                                  |

## Harvesting:
Can be harvested after 8-17 weeks.

## Curing:
<update>Curing is not necessary for ripe tomatoes. For green tomatoes harvested before monsoon rains, store in a cool, dry place to ripen gradually.</update>

## Storage
<update>In Sri Lanka's hot climate, store ripe tomatoes in a cool, shaded area. Use within 3-5 days for best quality. Avoid refrigeration as it affects flavor.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Aphids, Cutworms, Hornworms, Whiteflies, Flea beetles<update>, Fruit borer (Helicoverpa armigera)</update>

**Symptoms:** <update>Look for holes in fruits, wilting plants, curled or yellowing leaves, and presence of pests on undersides of leaves.</update>

**Control method:**
- Spray insecticides<update>Use neem oil or pyrethrum-based sprays, which are locally available and effective against many pests in Sri Lanka.</update>
- Sprinkle wood ash around the plant<update>This traditional method is still used by some Sri Lankan farmers to deter certain pests.</update>
- Keep surrounding area around the plant free from weed<update>Practice crop rotation and intercropping with marigolds or basil, which are common in Sri Lankan home gardens and help repel pests.</update>

### Disease Control
<update>Common diseases in Sri Lanka include early blight, late blight, and bacterial wilt. Practice crop rotation, use disease-resistant varieties, and ensure good drainage. Apply copper-based fungicides in severe cases, following local agricultural extension recommendations.</update>

## Difficulty Rating

### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Tomatoes require consistent moisture and warmth, which can be challenging in the wet zone's humid conditions.<update>High humidity and frequent rains in this zone increase the risk of fungal diseases. Proper drainage and disease management are crucial.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide adequate drainage
- Ensure good air circulation around plants
- Monitor for and manage fungal diseases
<update>- Use raised beds or container gardening
- Choose disease-resistant varieties suitable for wet conditions</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Tomatoes need consistent watering, which can be difficult in the dry zone's low rainfall conditions.<update>Water scarcity can be a major challenge, especially during prolonged dry spells.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide adequate watering
- Apply mulch to retain soil moisture
- Monitor for and manage heat stress
<update>- Implement water-efficient irrigation methods like drip irrigation
- Use drought-tolerant varieties</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Tomatoes prefer consistent temperatures, which can vary in the mid country's fluctuating climate.<update>The mid country's moderate climate is generally suitable for tomato cultivation, but pest management can be challenging.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide some shade during peak hours
- Monitor for and manage temperature extremes
<update>- Implement integrated pest management practices
- Use trellising to improve air circulation</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Tomatoes are not frost-tolerant, making them challenging to grow in the upcountry's cooler temperatures.<update>While frost is rare in Sri Lanka's upcountry, cooler temperatures can slow growth and extend the cultivation period.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide frost protection
- Choose heat-tolerant varieties suitable for higher elevations
- Extend the growing season using row covers or greenhouses
<update>- Use plastic mulch to warm the soil
- Select short-duration varieties adapted to cooler climates</update>
