## Description:
Papaya is a tropical fruit known for its sweet, juicy flesh and vibrant color. The fruit has a soft, butter-like consistency when ripe, with a central cavity filled with black, edible seeds. In Sri Lanka, papaya is widely cultivated in home gardens and commercial plantations, particularly in the low country wet and dry zones.

The taste of papaya is often described as a blend of mango and cantaloupe, with a subtle musky undertone. Ripe papayas have a rich, sweet flavor, while unripe green papayas have a milder, slightly bitter taste. The fruit's flavor can vary depending on the variety and growing conditions.

Several papaya varieties are cultivated in Sri Lanka, each with its own characteristics:

1. **Ratna:** The first papaya variety recommended by the Department of Agriculture. It produces medium-sized fruits (800g-1500g) with an attractive appearance and good taste. However, it's susceptible to Papaya ringspot virus.

2. **Horana Papaya Hybrid-1:** Known for its red flesh and excellent taste, with a sugar content (Brix) of about 12.5. The average fruit weight is 1.2-2 kg. This variety is fairly resistant to ringspot virus and yields well in dry and intermediate zones.

3. **Red Lady:** A high-quality imported hybrid that produces 60-80 fruits per tree annually. The fruits weigh 1.5-2.0 kg and have red flesh with a sugar content (Brix) of 12. It's resistant to ringspot virus disease, making it a popular choice for commercial cultivation.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Year-round in Sri Lanka, with best results when planted at the onset of rainy seasons.

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Propagation from seeds |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Plant the seeds in a pot for germination and when the seedlings are 1 foot tall, plant them on the ground. Papaya can survive long periods of neglect and will send deep roots in, so removing it will be quite difficult once the plant takes root |
| Soil | Requires well drained soil that is rich in organic matter. Prefer a soil pH of 5.5 to 6.5 |
| Water | Requires regular watering in the growing season. Keep the soil moist |
| Light | Requires full sunshine |

### Growing conditions:
| Temperatures | Thrives in Sri Lanka's tropical climate with temperatures between 25°C and 35°C |
|----|----|
| Soil | Add compost or manure into the soil |
| Water | Regular watering is crucial, especially during dry spells. In wet zones, ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging |
| Pruning | Papaya trees benefit from regular pruning to enhance growth and fruit production |
| Weed control | Removes weeds around the papaya tree by adding mulch or hand weeding |
 
## Harvesting:
Ripe papaya turns either yellow or an amber to orange hue depending on the type. Pick them when they are ripe. In Sri Lanka, papayas can be harvested year-round, with peak seasons typically occurring 6-9 months after planting.

Papayas can be consumed in various ways:
1. Fresh: Eaten raw as a dessert or in fruit salads
2. Green papaya: Used in salads or cooked as a vegetable in curries
3. Juice: Blended into refreshing drinks or smoothies

## Curing:
Papayas do not require curing after harvesting.

## Storage
Store ripe papayas at room temperature for up to 5 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. Unripe papayas can be stored at room temperature until ripe. In Sri Lanka's warm climate, refrigeration is recommended for extending shelf life.

## Water Management
- Maintain proper soil moisture, especially during dry spells.
- In wet zones, ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging.
- Consider drip irrigation for efficient water use, especially in dry zones.
- Water requirement varies from 4-20 liters per plant per day, depending on growth stage.

## Fertilizer Application
- Apply organic fertilizer (dung or well-digested compost) at 10 kg per pit 2 weeks before planting.
- Apply 500g of dolomite per trench 2 weeks before planting when soil pH is below 5 in wet zone.
- Apply chemical fertilizers every 2 months, adjusting based on plant growth and soil conditions.
- Consider fertigation (fertilizer application through irrigation system) for more efficient nutrient uptake.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control

**Pest types:**
- Mealy bug
- Scale insects
- Mites

**Symptoms:**
- **Mealy bug:** White fluffy layer covering leaves, stems, and fruits. Yellow sap-sucking areas on fruits. Black mold growth on leaves and fruits.
- **Scale insects:** Round brown scale-like insect colonies on fruits. Green and yellow discoloration on affected areas.
- **Mites:** Leaves bent downwards, shriveled and yellow. Mites visible on underside of infected leaves and along stems.

**Control methods:**
- **Mealy bug:** Clean with brush in early stages. Apply high-pressure water jets. Cut and burn damaged parts. Spray mineral oil solution.
- **Scale insects:** Apply recommended insecticides in high infestation conditions.
- **Mites:** Maintain good sanitation. Increase soil water retention. Provide proper irrigation. Plant Lantana Camara as hedge. Spray recommended sulfur mixture.

### Disease Control

**Disease types:**
- Ringspot virus
- Anthracnosis
- Phytophthora disease
- Leaf spot disease
- Root rot and stem rot
- Papaya phytoplasma disease

**Symptoms:**
- **Ringspot virus:** Yellow spots on young leaves, leaf discoloration and curling, reduced leaf width, wet spots on stems and leaves, ring spots on fruits.
- **Anthracnosis:** Small circular brown spots on ripening fruits, turning black with white fungus and pink spores.
- **Phytophthora disease:** Wet soft rot on fruits, spreading quickly.
- **Leaf spot disease:** Circular spots on leaves, grayish brown or light brown. Black spots on underside of leaves. Sunken circular black spots on fruits.
- **Root rot and stem rot:** Yellowing and falling of older leaves, withering of remaining leaves, root rot, wet rot on bark at stem base.
- **Papaya phytoplasma disease:** Stunted growth, deformed flowers and fruits, leaf fall, shortened petioles, yellow leaves, death of tree tip.

**Management:**
- **Ringspot virus:** Regular crop inspection, burn diseased trees, harvest and end crop if 20% infected.
- **Anthracnosis:** Careful fruit handling, apply fungicides like Mancozeb or Daconil.
- **Phytophthora disease:** Careful fruit handling, apply fungicides like Mancozeb or Daconil.
