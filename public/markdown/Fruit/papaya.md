## Description:
Papaya is a tropical fruit known for its sweet, juicy flesh and vibrant color. The fruit has a soft, butter-like consistency when ripe, with a central cavity filled with black, edible seeds. In Sri Lanka, papaya is widely cultivated in home gardens and commercial plantations, particularly in the low country wet and dry zones.

The taste of papaya is often described as a blend of mango and cantaloupe, with a subtle musky undertone. Ripe papayas have a rich, sweet flavor, while unripe green papayas have a milder, slightly bitter taste. The fruit's flavor can vary depending on the variety and growing conditions.

Several papaya varieties are cultivated in Sri Lanka, each with its own characteristics:

1. **Ratna:** The first papaya variety recommended by the Department of Agriculture. It produces medium-sized fruits (800g-1500g) with an attractive appearance and good taste. However, it's susceptible to Papaya ringspot virus.

2. **Horana Papaya Hybrid-1:** Known for its red flesh and excellent taste, with a sugar content (Brix) of about 12.5. The average fruit weight is 1.2-2 kg. This variety is fairly resistant to ringspot virus and yields well in dry and intermediate zones.

3. **Red Lady:** A high-quality imported hybrid that produces 60-80 fruits per tree annually. The fruits weigh 1.5-2.0 kg and have red flesh with a sugar content (Brix) of 12. It's resistant to ringspot virus disease, making it a popular choice for commercial cultivation.

Papayas can be consumed in various ways:
1. Fresh: Eaten raw as a dessert or in fruit salads
2. Green papaya: Used in salads or cooked as a vegetable in curries
3. Juice: Blended into refreshing drinks or smoothies


In Sri Lanka, papaya is not only valued for its taste but also for its nutritional benefits and versatility in local cuisine. It's a common sight in markets and is often served as a breakfast fruit or used in various dishes throughout the day. The availability of different varieties allows growers to choose types that best suit their local climate conditions and intended use, whether for home consumption or commercial production.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Year-round in Sri Lanka, with best results when planted at the onset of rainy seasons (Yala and Maha). Papaya can survive long periods of neglect and will send deep roots in, so removing it will be quite difficult once the plant takes root. 

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Plant the seeds in a pot for germination and when the seedlings are 1 foot tall, plant them on the ground |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Requires well drained soil that is rich in organic matter. Prefer a soil pH of 5.5 to 6.5 |
| Soil | Requires regular watering in the growing season. Keep the soil moist |
| Water | Requires full sunshine |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Thrives in Sri Lanka's tropical climate with temperatures between 25°C and 35°C |
|----|----|
| Soil | Add compost or manure into the soil |
| Water | Regular watering is crucial, especially during dry spells. In wet zones, ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging |
| Pruning | Propagation from seeds |

## Harvesting:
Ripe papaya turns either yellow or an amber to orange hue depending on the type. Pick them when they are ripe. In Sri Lanka, papayas can be harvested year-round, with peak seasons typically occurring 6-9 months after planting.

## Curing:
Papayas do not require curing after harvesting.

## Storage
Store ripe papayas at room temperature for up to 5 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. Unripe papayas can be stored at room temperature until ripe. In Sri Lanka's warm climate, refrigeration is recommended for extending shelf life.

## Water Management
- Maintain proper soil moisture, especially during dry spells.
- In wet zones, ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging.
- Consider drip irrigation for efficient water use, especially in dry zones.
- Water requirement varies from 4-20 liters per plant per day, depending on growth stage.

## Fertilizer Application
- Apply organic fertilizer (dung or well-digested compost) at 10 kg per pit 2 weeks before planting.
- Apply 500g of dolomite per trench 2 weeks before planting when soil pH is below 5 in wet zone.
- Apply chemical fertilizers every 2 months, adjusting based on plant growth and soil conditions.
- Consider fertigation (fertilizer application through irrigation system) for more efficient nutrient uptake.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Fruit flies, mealybugs, spider mites, and whiteflies

**Symptoms:** Leaf discoloration, wilting, and spots on fruits.

**Control method:** Use neem oil or pyrethrum-based organic insecticides. Implement fruit bagging techniques to protect against fruit flies. Maintain good air circulation to prevent pest buildup.

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** Papaya ringspot virus, anthracnose, and phytophthora root rot

**Symptoms:** Yellowing and mottling of leaves, stunted growth, and deformed fruits for papaya ringspot virus. Brown or black spots on fruits and leaves for anthracnose. Wilting and root decay for phytophthora root rot.

**Management:** Use disease-resistant varieties, practice crop rotation, maintain proper drainage, and apply copper-based fungicides when necessary. For viral diseases, control insect vectors and remove infected plants promptly.

## Post-Harvest Handling
- Harvest fruits when 15-25% yellow for best quality and shelf life.
