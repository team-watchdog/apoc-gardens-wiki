Fruit vary from very acid to very sweet. They grow wild and are also cultivated.

## Planting requirements
- Grows in humid and dry tropical climates
**Planting season:** <update>Year-round, but preferably at the onset of rainy seasons (March-April or September-October)</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | <update>Mostly grown from seeds or stem cuttings</update> |
|----|----|
| Planting method | When planting a young tree, dig a hole that's at least twice the width of the root ball, wider if possible. |
| Soil | <update>Prefers well-drained loamy soils with good organic matter. A pH of 5.5 to 7 is suitable.</update> |
| Water | Requires frequent watering for the young plant until established. |
| Light | Requires 6 hours of full sunshine |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Requires temperatures near 30°C give best production                                                                                                                                         |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Soil             | Add compost if desired. Mulch to a depth of 3"-4" around the tree, making sure to maintain at least a 4"-6" clear space around the trunk itself and keep the soil moist but not waterlogged. |
| Water            | <update>Requires moderate watering during dry spells and less during rainy seasons.</update>                                                                                                 |

## Harvesting:
Guava fruit ripens in its 2nd-4th year. Can pick the fruit when it's full-sized and has become slightly soft and aromatic. But it can be harvested prior to full ripeness as well and will continue to ripen off the tree.

## Curing:
No curing required for guava fruits.

## Storage
<update>Guavas can be stored at room temperature for up to 5 days or refrigerated for up to 2 weeks. In Sri Lanka, they are often stored in cool, well-ventilated areas or in clay pots with damp sand.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Fruit fly, larvae, red-banded thrips, whiteflies, green shield scale and weevils
**Symptoms:**
**Control method:** Pick the fruit prior to full maturity, wrapping the developing fruit with a paper bag when it is immature, spray neem oil.<update>Use pheromone traps or other organic pesticides.</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** <update>Guavas in Sri Lanka are susceptible to wilt disease, anthracnose, and algal leaf spot. Control methods include pruning affected parts, using copper-based fungicides, and improving drainage.</update>
**Symptoms:** 
**Management:** 

## Difficulty Rating

### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Guava grows well in the low country wet zone due to adequate rainfall, but requires management to prevent fungal diseases.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Maintain good air circulation around plants.
- Avoid overhead watering to prevent disease spread.
- <update>Use raised beds or mounds to improve drainage in heavy rainfall areas.</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Guava can thrive in the dry zone with proper irrigation, but requires careful water management during dry spells.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure consistent watering during dry periods.
- <update>Use mulching to conserve soil moisture.</update>
- Apply balanced fertilizers regularly.

### Mid country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Guava grows exceptionally well in the mid country of Sri Lanka due to favorable climate conditions.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Monitor soil moisture levels and apply balanced fertilizers.
- <update>Protect from strong winds, especially during the monsoon season.</update>
- Maintain good air circulation to prevent disease buildup.

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Guava can be challenging to grow in the up country due to cooler temperatures, but some varieties can adapt well.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Choose cold-tolerant varieties suitable for up country conditions.</update>
- Maintain good air circulation to prevent disease buildup.
- <update>Provide protection from frost and strong winds, common in higher elevations.</update>
- Apply balanced fertilizers regularly, but avoid overfertilizing as it can cause excessive vegetative growth at the expense of fruit production.
