## Description:
Chrysophyllum cainito is a tropical tree of the family Sapotaceae. It is native to the Isthmus of Panama, where it was domesticated. It has spread to the Greater Antilles and the West Indies and is now grown throughout the tropics, including Southeast Asia. It grows rapidly and can reach a height range of 6 to 18 meters. There are two types found in Sri Lanka discernible by the colour of the fruit. One is purple while the other is green.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** February to April

### Planting conditions:
- Hot tropical climate

| **Propagation** | While seeds can be used, most successful propagation occurs through cuttings or grafting                   |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Planting method | Direct seeding or budding. The seeds germinate easily and are viable for several months. Plant them about an inch deep in a small container kept outdoors. Once the seeds have established roots and are actively growing, you can transplant into the ground or a larger container.If you chose to start with a sapling, it can be planted straight in the ground. Dig a hole that's 3 times wider and deeper than the root ball. |
| Soil            | well drained, loamy soil with pH between 6.0 to 7.5. However, some sources suggest a slightly lower pH range of 5.5 to 6.5 |
| Water           | Consistent deep watering is emphasized, which is crucial for the tree's health.                                                                 |
| Sunlight        | Full sun                                                                                 |

### Growing conditions:

| Temperatures | 25-32 degrees celsius. However, some sources indicate that the tree can tolerate temperatures as low as 22 degrees Celsius |
|----|----|
| Soil | Soil must be kept well drained |
| Water | Deep consistent watering |
| Pruning | is necessary for keeping your chrysophyllum cainito at an ideal size. Because fruits don't fall off when ripe, maintain it at a height that you're able to harvest. Prune as needed every 1-3 years to keep it in shape. When the tree is mature, maintain a bush canopy, which will boost fruit production. |

## Harvesting:
If grown from seed the Star Apple tree can produce fruit in about 4 years. But if you buy a sapling from a nursery that was grafted onto rootstock or propagated from a branch, it can grow fruit in as few as 1 to 2 years after planting.  

## Curing:
Star Apple does not require a curing stage.

## Storage
Star apples are best eaten when fresh but fruits can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:**
- Moth larvae

**Symptoms:**
- **Moth larvae:** Attacks the flowers.

**Control method:** Organic insecticides are effective. Use sparingly.

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** 
- Red algae (_Cephaleuros virescens_)
- various fungi (_Phomopsis sp._ and _Phyllosticta sp._)

**Symptoms:** 
- **Red algae:** Causes stem and limb dieback
- **Fungi:** Leaves may be attacked, fruit may also be attacked, causing it to dry-rot.

**Management:** 
- **Fungi:** Avoid overhead irrigation, maintain good air circulation, and use fungicides when necessary.

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Requires consistent moisture but is prone to root rot in waterlogged conditions. The high humidity can also encourage fungal diseases.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Regular monitoring for root rot and fungal diseases is necessary. Ensure good drainage and avoid overhead irrigation.

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Tolerates drought once established, but fruit production may decrease in prolonged dry periods. The hot temperatures can also stress the tree.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Deep watering during fruiting season to maintain productivity. Provide shade during extreme heat.

### Mid country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Requires consistent moisture and protection from strong winds. The cooler temperatures at higher elevations may affect fruit production.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide windbreaks and ensure adequate water supply. Maintain warmer microclimate if possible to encourage fruit production.

### Up country (Difficulty: 8/10)
**Explanation:** Not well suited to high elevations due to cold temperatures. Frost can damage the tree and flowers, reducing fruit production.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Grow in a protected location with warmer microclimate or use row covers during cold periods. Consider using heat-trapping techniques like mulching or plastic covers.
