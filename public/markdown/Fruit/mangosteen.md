## General Information
**Generic name:** Mangosteen, Gamboge
**Sri Lankan name:** Mangus (Sinhala, Tamil)
**Scientific name:** Garcinia mangostana
**Plant family:** Clusiaceae
**Edible parts:** Fruit
**Other uses:** Mangosteen bark contains xanthones which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It is used in traditional medicine for treating various ailments. In Sri Lanka, the fruit rind is used to make herbal teas and in Ayurvedic preparations.

### Companion plants:
- **Peanut:** Acts as a ground cover, reducing soil erosion and adding nitrogen to the soil.
- **Banana:** Provides shade for young mangosteen trees and helps maintain soil moisture.
- **Durian:** Shares similar growing conditions and can create a beneficial microclimate.
- **Dragonfruit:** Can be grown as a climbing plant on mangosteen trees, maximizing space utilization.
- **Guava:** Attracts pollinators and can help improve fruit set in the orchard.
- **Rambutan:** Shares similar soil and climate requirements, making it a good companion in mixed orchards.
- **Coconut:** Provides partial shade and can act as a windbreak for mangosteen trees.

### Non-companion plants:
- **Citrus trees:** Should not be planted near mangosteen as they compete for nutrients and may have antagonistic root interactions.

## Description:
Mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana), also known as the purple mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen tree with edible fruit native to tropical lands surrounding the Indian Ocean. Its origin is uncertain due to widespread prehistoric cultivation. It grows mainly in Southeast Asia, southwest India and other tropical areas such as Colombia and Puerto Rico, where the tree has been introduced. In Sri Lanka, mangosteen is primarily grown in the wet and intermediate zones, particularly in districts like Galle, Matara, and Ratnapura.

A tropical tree, the mangosteen must be grown in consistently warm conditions, as exposure to temperatures below 0 °C for prolonged periods will usually kill a mature plant. They are known to recover from brief cold spells rather well, often with damage only to young growth. The tree grows from 6 to 25 metres (20 to 82 feet) tall.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Mangosteen trees can be planted throughout the year in Sri Lanka but the best time is during the monsoon seasons (May to August and October to December). This coincides with the Yala and Maha seasons in Sri Lanka, ensuring adequate rainfall for establishment.

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Direct seeding is possible but transplanting is recommended. |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Dig a deep hole, twice the width and depth of the container. Fill it halfway with nutrient-rich soil loaded with organic matter at least 30 days before planting. |
| Soil | Deep loamy, sandy soil is a must and you have to dig in well-rotted manure and quality compost when prepping the bed. Seeds should be planted in coir or sand nurseries at a distance of 10-15 cm from each other. Seeds should germinate in 3-4 weeks. In 4-6 months, the seedlings should be transferred to a secondary nursery (pots). When the sapling is about 48 inches high it can be transplanted to the field. |
| Water | Constant moisture is necessary. Mangosteen is known to grow best in soil adjacent to a water source. |
| Light | Full sunlight |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | 25-28 degrees celsius |
|----|----|
| Soil | Deep loamy soil with plenty of organic matter |
| Water | Constant moisture and rainfall of between 1500-2000mm is required |
| Pruning | Prune in the dry season to remove dead or diseased branches. In Sri Lanka, this is typically done between January and March. |
| Weed control | Keep the area around the tree free from weeds as they compete for nutrients and water. Use mulch to suppress weed growth and retain soil moisture. |

## Harvesting:
After about 10-12 years of planting a seedling, a single tree should provide an initial harvest of 20-30 fruits per year. Yield increases as the tree matures. A well-grown tree can produce 500-1500 fruits per year.

Harvest when the fruit is fully ripe and has turned purple-black in colour. In Sri Lanka, the main harvesting season is typically from May to August.

## Curing:
After harvesting, cure mangosteens at room temperature for a week to allow the flavour to develop. In Sri Lanka's humid climate, ensure good air circulation to prevent mold growth during curing.

## Storage
Store mangosteens in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. Do not store at temperatures below 40°F (4°C) as they may freeze and become damaged. In Sri Lanka, where refrigeration may not always be available, store in a cool, dry place and consume within a few days.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Mangosteen trees contain a bitter latex that protects it from most insects or diseases. There are some common issues to watch for including anthracnose, mangosteen caterpillar, bacterial blackspot, and yellow leaves.

**Symptoms:** Anthracnose causes brown spots on leaves which eventually turn black and fall off. Mangosteen caterpillars cause defoliation while bacterial blackspot causes dark spots on leaves. In Sri Lanka, thrips can also be a problem, causing scarring on the fruit skin.

**Control method:** Organic fungicides and pesticides containing the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis work well as pest-control. Leaves turn yellow in the event of nitrogen deficiency in which case fish emulsion or nitrogen fertiliser maybe required. In Sri Lanka, neem-based pesticides are commonly used for organic pest control.

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** Root rot is a common disease in mangosteen trees, especially in areas with poor drainage.

**Symptoms:** Root rot causes wilting and yellowing of leaves, and eventually the tree dies. In Sri Lanka's wet climate, it's particularly important to watch for these symptoms.

**Management:** Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. If the tree shows symptoms of root rot, prune affected roots and treat with a fungicide. In Sri Lanka, improving soil drainage and using raised beds can help prevent root rot in high-rainfall areas.

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Mangosteen trees thrive in warm temperatures and high humidity, which are characteristics of Sri Lanka's low country wet zone.
**Challenges/Adaptations:** 
- Excessive rainfall can lead to waterlogging, so ensure good drainage through raised beds or improved soil structure.
- Risk of root rot in poorly drained areas; implement proper water management practices.
- Potential for fungal diseases due to high humidity; use organic fungicides and ensure good air circulation.
- Thrips can be a problem; use neem-based pesticides for organic control.

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** The dry zone has lower humidity and less rainfall than the wet zone, which can stress mangosteen trees.
**Challenges/Adaptations:** 
- Provide additional water during the dry season to maintain constant moisture.
- Implement drip irrigation and mulching to conserve water.
- Use companion plants like banana or coconut to provide shade and help maintain soil moisture.
- Higher risk of heat stress; provide partial shade for young trees.

### Mid country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** The mid country has a moderate climate suitable for mangosteen, but with some challenges.
**Challenges/Adaptations:** 
- Protect trees from strong winds by using windbreaks or planting in sheltered locations.
- Implement proper drainage systems to manage heavy rainfall.
- May require additional care during cooler periods; avoid planting in frost-prone areas.
- Use companion plants like durian or rambutan to create beneficial microclimates.

### Up country (Difficulty: 9/10)
**Explanation:** The up country has cooler temperatures and lower humidity, which is not suitable for mangosteen trees.
**Challenges/Adaptations:** 
- Cultivation is not recommended in areas above 600m elevation due to cold climate.
- If attempted at lower elevations of up country:
  - Provide significant protection from cold winds.
  - Create warm microclimates using south-facing slopes and heat-retaining structures.
  - Be prepared for slower growth and potentially lower yields.
  - Consider greenhouse cultivation for better temperature control.
