## Description:
Pineapple plants can be easily grown by planting the pineapple tops in soil. The pineapple top grows into a bushy plant. If you get growing conditions right, the pineapple plant flowers and a pineapple fruit eventually appears. Pineapples can grow in pots indoors, or if you live in warmer climates it can grow outdoors in your garden.

In Sri Lanka, pineapples are commonly grown in the low country wet and intermediate zones, particularly in areas like Gampaha, Kurunegala, and Ratnapura districts. The fruit is known for its sweet-tart flavor, juicy texture, and tropical aroma. Sri Lankan pineapples are often described as having a perfect balance of sweetness and acidity, with a rich, golden flesh that's both refreshing and satisfying.

Pineapples are widely used:
1. Fresh consumption: Eaten as a refreshing snack or dessert, especially during hot weather.
2. Culinary uses: Used in fruit salads, curries (particularly with seafood), and as a meat tenderizer.
3. Beverages: Pineapple juice is popular, often mixed with other tropical fruits or used in cocktails.
4. Traditional medicine: Used in Ayurvedic and traditional remedies for digestive issues and inflammation.
5. Preserves: Made into jams, chutneys, and candied fruit.
6. Tourism industry: Featured in tropical fruit platters for tourists and used to make welcome drinks in hotels.
7. Export: High-quality Sri Lankan pineapples are exported, contributing to the country's agricultural economy.


## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Can be planted year-round in Sri Lanka, but best during April to May or September to October

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Propagated from suckers |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Prepare 20 cm width and 20 cm deep trenches. Put the suckers in the trenches and add the soil to cover 10 - 15 cm of sucker base |
| Soil | Needs well drained Sandy Loams soil with pH 5-6 for cultivation |
| Water | Requires moderate water but not overwatering |
| Light | Requires at least 6 hours of sunshine |

### Growing conditions:
| Temperatures | Thrives in Sri Lanka's tropical climate, with optimal temperatures between 23-32°C |
|----|----|
| Soil | Make sure your soil is thickly mulched to reduce evaporation. The plant requires lots of nutrition. Mix compost in with your soil before you plant the pineapple, and then mulch thickly around it |
| Water | Always water from top down. They are tolerant of being under-watered rather than over-watered |
| Pruning | Prune suckers that grow around the main plant to encourage fruit production |
| Weed control | Keep the area around the plant weed-free to prevent competition for nutrients and water |

## Harvesting:
Well matured fruits with 25% colour change from the fruit base are suitable for harvesting. Fruits should be harvested with 10-15 cm of stem.

## Curing:
After harvest, cure pineapples at room temperature for a few days to develop their full flavor.

## Storage
Store ripe pineapples in the refrigerator for up to five days. Unripe pineapples can be stored at room temperature until ripe.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest types:**
- Mealy bugs
- Pineapple mites
- Nematodes

**Symptoms:**
- Mealy bugs: Small, cottony masses on leaves and stems
- Pineapple mites: Bronzing of leaves
- Nematodes: Stunted growth and yellowing

**Control methods:**
- Select healthy suckers
- Pre-treatment prior to planting
- Weed control
- Spray insecticides with neem oil or insecticidal soap
- Use approved pesticides as per local agricultural department recommendations

### Disease Control
**Disease types:**
- Top rot
- Base rot
- Fruit collapse

**Symptoms:**
- Top rot: Center leaves wilt and rot
- Base rot: Plant collapse
- Fruit collapse: Soft, watery fruit

**Management:**
- Avoid overwatering
- Maintain good air circulation
- Use disease-resistant varieties
- Treat with fungicides if necessary
- Practice crop rotation
- Use clean planting material

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Pineapples grow well in this zone, with abundant rainfall and suitable temperatures.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Root rot can be a problem during extremely wet periods. Ensure good drainage and avoid overwatering.
- Use raised beds or mounds to improve drainage during heavy rains.
- The humid climate is ideal for pineapple growth, reducing the need for frequent watering.

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Pineapples can tolerate some drought once established, but may require additional care in dry periods.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Water stress can cause fruit to be small and less sweet. Provide adequate water, especially during fruiting.
- Use mulch to conserve soil moisture and consider drip irrigation.
- The dry climate can help reduce disease incidence, making pest management easier.

### Mid country (Difficulty: 2/10)
**Explanation:** The moderate climate of the mid country is highly suitable for pineapple cultivation, offering an excellent balance of temperature and rainfall.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Mild temperature fluctuations are generally beneficial for fruit development.
- Implement windbreaks to protect plants from occasional strong winds.
- The climate in this zone is ideal for producing high-quality, flavorful pineapples.

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** The cooler temperatures and shorter days of the up country can make pineapple cultivation more challenging, but not impossible.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Pineapples may take longer to ripen in cooler conditions. Provide additional warmth, such as row covers or greenhouse protection.
- Choose sheltered locations and consider using plastic mulch to increase soil temperature.
- Focus on growing pineapples for local consumption, as the cooler climate may produce less sweet but more aromatic fruits.
