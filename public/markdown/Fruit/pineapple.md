## Description:
Pineapple plants can be easily grown by planting the pineapple tops in soil. The pineapple top grows into a bushy plant. If you get growing conditions right, the pineapple plant flowers and a pineapple fruit eventually appears. <update>In Sri Lanka, pineapples are commonly grown in the low country wet and intermediate zones, particularly in areas like Gampaha, Kurunegala, and Ratnapura districts.</update>

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>Can be planted year-round in Sri Lanka, but best during the onset of rainy seasons (April-May or September-October)</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Propagated from suckers |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Prepare 20 cm width and 20 cm deep trenches. Put the suckers in the trenches and add the soil to cover 10 - 15 cm of sucker base |
| Soil | Needs well drained Sandy Loams soil with pH 5 -6 for cultivation |
| Water | Requires moderate water but not overwatering |
| Light | Requires at least 6 hours of sunshine |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | <update>Thrives in Sri Lanka's tropical climate, with optimal temperatures between 23-32Â°C</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | Make sure your soil is thickly mulched to reduce evaporation. The plant requires lots of nutrition. Mix compost in with your soil before you plant the pineapple, and then mulch thickly around it. |
| Water | Always water from top down. They are tolerant of being under-watered rather than over-watered |
| Pruning | Prune suckers that grow around the main plant to encourage fruit production.
| Weed control | Keep the area around the plant weed-free to prevent competition for nutrients and water.

## Harvesting:
Well matured fruits with 25% colour change from the fruit base are suitable for harvesting. Fruits should be harvested with 10-15 cm of stem.

## Curing:
After harvest, cure pineapples at room temperature for a few days to develop their full flavor.

## Storage
Store ripe pineapples in the refrigerator for up to five days. Unripe pineapples can be stored at room temperature until ripe.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Mealy bugs, <update>pineapple mites, nematodes</update>

**Symptoms:** Mealybugs appear as small, cottony masses on leaves and stems. <update>Mites cause bronzing of leaves, while nematodes lead to stunted growth and yellowing.</update>

**Control method:** Select healthy suckers, pre treatment prior to planting, weed control, spray insecticides with neem oil or insecticidal soap. <update>Use approved pesticides as per local agricultural department recommendations.</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** <update>Top rot, base rot, fruit collapse</update>

**Symptoms:** <update>Top rot causes the center leaves to wilt and rot. Base rot leads to plant collapse. Fruit collapse results in soft, watery fruit.</update>

**Management:** Avoid overwatering, maintain good air circulation, use disease-resistant varieties, and treat with fungicides if necessary. <update>Practice crop rotation and use clean planting material.</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Pineapples grow well in this zone, but require careful water management.</update>
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Root rot can be a problem. Ensure good drainage and avoid overwatering.
- <update>Use raised beds or mounds to improve drainage during heavy rains.</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Pineapples prefer consistent moisture but can tolerate some drought once established.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Water stress can cause fruit to be small and tasteless. Provide adequate water, especially during fruiting.
- <update>Use mulch to conserve soil moisture and consider drip irrigation.</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** <update>The moderate climate of the mid country is highly suitable for pineapple cultivation.</update>
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Temperature fluctuations can affect fruit set. Provide some shade during extreme heat.
- <update>Implement windbreaks to protect plants from strong winds.</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 8/10)
**Explanation:** The cooler temperatures and shorter days of the up country can make pineapple cultivation challenging.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Pineapples may not ripen properly in cool conditions. Provide additional warmth, such as row covers or greenhouse protection.
- <update>Choose sheltered locations and consider using plastic mulch to increase soil temperature.</update>
