## Description:
Mangoes are erect, branched evergreen trees that grow up to 40 m high and can be long lived. Trees spread to 15 m across and have strong deep roots. The leaves are 10–30 cm long, 2–10 cm wide, shaped like a spear and are arranged in spirals. Some kinds of mangoes have leaves with a wavy edge. <update>In Sri Lanka, there are several local varieties of mangoes, including Willard, Karutha Colomban, and Malwana.</update>

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>May to August (during the Southwest monsoon)</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Seeds germinate in 3–6 weeks |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Should be planted keeping a spacing of 6–12 m between plants. The size of the planting hole should be 60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm |
| Soil | Can grow in a range of soils. In wetter areas, soils with less clay are better. They can also withstand occasional flooding. A soil pH of 5.5 to 6.5 is best. Soils with pH above 7.5 cause plants to develop iron deficiency |
| Water | Young plants require regular watering. Water the trees right after planting and during drought periods. |
| Light | Full sunshine (8-10 hours of direct sun is optimal) |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | They thrive best where temperatures are about 25°C but will grow with temperatures between 10 and 42°C |
|----|----|
| Soil | Deep, rich, well drained soils provide the best production. Fill the planting hole with organic manure and top soil before 2 weeks of planting |
| Water | Mango trees grow best when watered using a wet/dry cycle. This means irrigating until the soil is fully saturated, then waiting until the soil is relatively dry before watering again. Mangos do not tolerate constantly wet conditions, so allowing the soil to dry down will keep the mango tree healthy. Soaker hoses, micro-sprinklers, or drip irrigation is preferred to prevent excessive water runoff. |
| Fertiliser / Mulch | <update>

## Harvesting:
Seedling trees produce after 4–6 years and increase in production up to 20 years.  Harvesting should be done between 10.00 am to 3.00 pm, using a fruit picker. <update>In Sri Lanka, harvesting typically occurs from May to July. Use a fruit picker or carefully climb the tree to harvest ripe fruits.</update>

## Curing:
<update>
- After harvesting, cure the mangoes at room temperature for about 3-5 days to allow the skin color to deepen and the flavor to develop.
- Keep fruits in a single layer in a well-ventilated area.
</update>

## Storage:
<update>
- Store ripe mangoes in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
- Unripe mangoes can be stored at room temperature for up to a week or in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.
- For long-term storage, mangoes can be cut and frozen or made into preserves.
</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Mango fruit fly, Mango hopper, Mango seed Weevil, Leaf cutting Weevil, Mango steam borer

**Symptoms:**
<update>
- Mango fruit fly: Small holes in the fruit skin with oozing liquid.
- Mango hopper: Yellowish-green insects on leaves and stems, causing leaf burn and flower drop.
- Mango seed weevil: Holes in seeds and kernels, visible when cutting the fruit.
- Leaf cutting weevil: Irregular shaped holes in leaves, particularly on young foliage.
- Mango steam borer: Holes in the trunk and branches, with sawdust-like frass exiting.
</update>

**Control method:** <update>Spraying neem-based insecticides, regular weeding and pruning of overlapping/overcrowded branches, planting resistant varieties, removing and destroying affected stem parts. Use pheromone traps for fruit flies.</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:**
<update>
- Anthracnose: A fungal disease that causes black spots on leaves and fruit.
- Powdery mildew: A fungal disease that causes white patches on leaves.
- Sooty mold: A fungal growth that appears as a black coating on leaves and fruits.
</update>

**Symptoms:**
<update>
- Anthracnose: Black spots on leaves and fruit, with a yellow halo around the spot.
- Powdery mildew: White patches on leaves, often with distorted growth.
- Sooty mold: Black, soot-like coating on leaves and fruits, often associated with scale insect infestations.
</update>

**Management:**
<update>
- Prune affected branches and destroy them.
- Apply copper-based fungicides as per manufacturer's instructions.
- Maintain good air circulation by pruning trees and removing dead leaves.
- For sooty mold, control scale insects with insecticidal soaps or neem oil.
</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Mangoes can be challenging to grow in the wet zone due to high humidity and rainfall, which can increase the risk of fungal diseases. The warm temperatures are suitable for mango growth, but the wet conditions require careful management.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Regularly monitor for and manage fungal diseases such as anthracnose and powdery mildew.
- Ensure good air circulation around trees by pruning regularly to prevent disease spread.
- Maintain proper drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can harm the roots.

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Mangoes are relatively easy to grow in the dry zone as temperatures are suitable for growth. However, they require regular watering during drought periods due to low rainfall.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide adequate water during drought periods using drip irrigation or other efficient watering methods.
- Protect young trees from strong winds by providing support or planting in a sheltered location.
- Apply organic mulch around the base of the tree to retain moisture and suppress weeds.

### Mid country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Mangoes can be grown successfully in the mid country, but they may require some protection from strong winds and occasional frost. The cooler temperatures compared to other zones might affect fruit set and growth rate.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide windbreaks to protect young trees from strong winds.
- Apply a light mulch around the base of the tree to help retain moisture during dry periods.
- Protect trees from frost using row covers or by planting in a sheltered location.

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Mangoes can be challenging to grow in the up country due to cooler temperatures and occasional frost. The lower temperatures may limit fruit production and tree growth.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide protection from frost by planting in a sheltered location or using row covers during cold periods.
- Ensure trees have adequate water during dry periods, as they may require more frequent irrigation due to cooler temperatures.
- Choose early-ripening varieties that are better suited to cooler climates.
