## General Information
**Generic name:** Mango
**Sri Lankan name:** Amba (Sinhala), Māṅkāy (Tamil)
**Scientific name:** Mangifera indica
**Plant family:** Anacardiaceae
**Edible parts:** Fruit, young leaves
**Nutrition value:** lots of Vitamin C
**Companion plants:**
Mango trees are typically planted in isolation, but can be supplemented by:

- Legumes such as beans and peas: these act as nitrogen-fixers
- Bananas: Compatible in agroforestry systems with mangoes, especially since they provide biomass and mulch
- Cocoa: Can be integrated into mango-based agroforestry systems
- Ginger: Repels pests and improves soil microbial abundance.
- Turmeric: Pairs with ginger to repel pests and enhance soil health.
- Nasturtium: Attracts pollinators and acts as a trap crop for pests.
- Comfrey: Provides nutrient-rich mulch and fixes nitrogen in the soil.

**Non-companion plants:**
- Avoid planting near coconut trees as they compete for nutrients and water.
- Avoid other mango trees planted too closely: A 10m x 10m spacing is recommended to avoid competition

## Description:
Mangoes are erect, branched evergreen trees that grow up to 40 m high and can be long lived. Trees spread to 15 m across and have strong deep roots. The leaves are 10–30 cm long, 2–10 cm wide, shaped like a spear and are arranged in spirals. Some kinds of mangoes have leaves with a wavy edge. In Sri Lanka, there are several local varieties of mangoes, including Willard, Karutha Colomban, Malwana, Horanahiru, Velleicolomban, and TOM EJC.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** May to August, best done before the onset of the rainy season.

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Seeds germinate in 3–6 weeks |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Should be planted keeping a spacing of 6–12 m between plants. The size of the planting hole should be 60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm, or 90 cm x 90 cm x 90 cm if the soil is very hard |
| Soil | Can grow in a range of soils. In wetter areas, soils with less clay are better. They can also withstand occasional flooding. A soil pH of 5.5 to 6.5 is best. Soils with pH above 7.5 cause plants to develop iron deficiency |
| Water | Young plants require regular watering. Water the trees right after planting and during drought periods |
| Light | Full sunshine (8-10 hours of direct sun is optimal) |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | They thrive best where temperatures are about 25°C but will grow with temperatures between 10 and 42°C |
|----|----|
| Soil | Deep, rich, well drained soils provide the best production. Fill the planting hole with organic manure and top soil 2 weeks before planting |
| Water | Mango trees grow best when watered using a wet/dry cycle. This means irrigating until the soil is fully saturated, then waiting until the soil is relatively dry before watering again. Mangos do not tolerate constantly wet conditions, so allowing the soil to dry down will keep the mango tree healthy. Soaker hoses, micro-sprinklers, or drip irrigation is preferred to prevent excessive water runoff |
| Fertiliser / Mulch | Fertilize mango trees in spring and summer only, and only a little at a time. Foliar spraying with fish fertilizer or seaweed solution can provide trace elements and avoid deficiencies |

## Pruning:
Mangoes respond very well to pruning. It can be used to control tree size and shape, improve productivity, and enhance fruit quality. Prune to maintain an open crown, allowing air and light to penetrate. Regular pruning helps in canopy management, which is essential for good productivity.

## Harvesting:
Seedling trees produce after 4–6 years and increase in production up to 20 years. Harvesting should be done between 10.00 am to 3.00 pm, using a fruit picker. In Sri Lanka, harvesting typically occurs from May to July. Fruits can be harvested when they change color from dark green to light green, or when yellow color appears on either side of the green shoulder.

Caution: Be careful of the mango sap when harvesting, as it can cause burns, allergies, and dermatitis.

## Curing:
- After harvesting, cure the mangoes at room temperature for about 3-5 days to allow the skin color to deepen and the flavor to develop.
- Keep fruits in a single layer in a well-ventilated area.

## Storage:
- Store ripe mangoes in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
- Unripe mangoes can be stored at room temperature for up to a week or in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.
- For long-term storage, mangoes can be cut and frozen or made into preserves.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest types:** Mango fruit fly, Mango hopper, Mango seed Weevil, Leaf cutting Weevil, Mango stem borer, Mealy bugs, Trips, Termites, Mites, Scales

**Symptoms:**
- Mango fruit fly: Small holes in the fruit skin with oozing liquid.
- Mango hopper: Yellowish-green insects on leaves and stems, causing leaf burn and flower drop.
- Mango seed weevil: Holes in seeds and kernels, visible when cutting the fruit.
- Leaf cutting weevil: Irregular shaped holes in leaves, particularly on young foliage.
- Mango stem borer: Holes in the trunk and branches, with sawdust-like frass exiting.
- Mealy bugs: Cottony appearance on plant parts, sap sucking.
- Trips: Brownish patches on leaf surface.
- Termites: Attack areas of dead wood.
- Mites: Brown color patches on fruit peel, retarded fruit growth.
- Scales: Retarded tree growth, poor flowering.

**Control method:** Spraying neem-based insecticides, regular weeding and pruning of overlapping/overcrowded branches, planting resistant varieties, removing and destroying affected stem parts. Use pheromone traps for fruit flies. For specific pests:
- Trips and Mites: Spray sulfur or miticide at early stages.
- Scales: Use natural enemies.
- Termites: Avoid trunk injury, use appropriate insecticides.

### Disease Control
**Disease types:**
- Anthracnose: A fungal disease that causes black spots on leaves and fruit.
- Powdery mildew: A fungal disease that causes white patches on leaves.
- Sooty mold: A fungal growth that appears as a black coating on leaves and fruits.
- Stem end rot: Dark rot developing from the stem end as fruit ripens.
- Leaf spot diseases: Fungal, bacterial, and algal leaf spots.

**Symptoms:**
- Anthracnose: Black spots on leaves and fruit, with a yellow halo around the spot.
- Powdery mildew: White patches on leaves, often with distorted growth.
- Sooty mold: Black, soot-like coating on leaves and fruits, often associated with scale insect infestations.
- Stem end rot: Dark brown to black rot beginning at the stem end.
- Leaf spots: Irregular ash-colored spots (fungal), water-soaked blackish triangular lesions (bacterial), or whitish-grey spots (algal) on leaves.

**Management:**
- Prune affected branches and destroy them.
- Apply copper-based fungicides as per manufacturer's instructions.
- Maintain good air circulation by pruning trees and removing dead leaves.
- For sooty mold, control scale insects with insecticidal soaps or neem oil.
- For leaf spots, apply mancozeb and improve air circulation.

## Growing Mangoes from Seed
- Select seeds from polyembryonic varieties for true-to-type trees.
- Common polyembryonic varieties in Sri Lanka include Karthacolomban and Velleicolomban.
- To germinate, either place the whole seed in a warm, moist place or carefully extract the embryos and plant individually.
- Seedling trees may take 5-8 years to fruit, compared to 3-4 years for grafted trees.

### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** While mangoes can face challenges in the wet zone due to high humidity and rainfall, there are varieties specifically recommended for this area.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Regularly monitor for and manage fungal diseases such as anthracnose and powdery mildew.
- Ensure good air circulation around trees by pruning regularly to prevent disease spread.
- Maintain proper drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can harm the roots.
- Use bagging practices to get yellow peel color and reduce pest incidents.

**Recommended varieties:** 
- Horanahiru: Fast vegetative growth, regular and prolific flowering, moderately resistant to Anthracnose.
- Dampara: Round shape, pale green color, dark yellow flesh.
- Giraamba: Conspicuous beak, dark orange flesh, unique taste.

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Mangoes are well-suited to the dry zone, with several varieties recommended for this area. The main challenge is water management during drought periods.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide adequate water during drought periods using drip irrigation or other efficient watering methods.
- Protect young trees from strong winds by providing support or planting in a sheltered location.
- Apply organic mulch around the base of the tree to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
- Consider high-density planting for commercial cultivation of certain varieties like TOM EJC.

**Recommended varieties:** 
- Karthacolomban: Long shape, dark green and thick peel, soft golden color and juicy flesh.
- Willard (Villard): Red peel color, round shape, soft peel, low fiber content.
- TOM EJC: Large fruit, orange flesh with less fiber, good for commercial cultivation.
- Malwana: Medium size, light green color, good taste.

### Intermediate zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** The intermediate zone offers a balance between wet and dry conditions, making it suitable for several mango varieties. 

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Balance water management between wet and dry periods.
- Apply appropriate pruning techniques for canopy management.
- Use flowering induction techniques like Paclobutrazol application when necessary.

**Recommended varieties:**
- Velleicolomban: Polyembryonic, light green color, low fiber content, golden yellow and juicy flesh.
- Karthacolomban: Suitable for both dry and intermediate zones.
- Malwana: Recommended for both dry and intermediate zones.

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Mangoes can be challenging to grow in the up country due to cooler temperatures. 

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide protection from frost by planting in a sheltered location or using row covers during cold periods.
- Ensure trees have adequate water during dry periods, as they may require more frequent irrigation due to cooler temperatures.
- Consider using dwarf varieties or intensive pruning to manage tree size in cooler climates.
- Choose early-ripening varieties that are better suited to cooler climates.
