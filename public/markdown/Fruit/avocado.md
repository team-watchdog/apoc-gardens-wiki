## Description:
The avocado is a medium-sized, evergreen tree in the laurel family (Lauraceae). It is native to the Americas and was first domesticated by Mesoamerican tribes more than 5,000 years ago. Then as now, it was prized for its large and unusually oily fruit. The tree likely originated in the highlands bridging south-central Mexico and Guatemala.

Its fruit is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** February to April

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Grafting is recommended for consistent fruit output. Saplings should initially be planted in a nursery and transplanted to the field 4-6 months later. Plants should be spaced at 8x8 meters. This should allow for the planting of 60-80 trees per acre. |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Well-draining deep loamy soil with a pH value of about 5.7 |
| Soil | Keep soil moist but not waterlogged. |
| Water | Full or partial sunlight |

### Growing conditions:
- Grows best in the wet zones in Sri Lanka. Requires annual rainfall of 1200-1300mm. 

| Temperatures | Under 30 degrees Celsius |
|----|----|
| Soil | Keep the soil well drained. |
| Water | Requires a moderate and regular supply of water, but it doesn't tolerate waterlogged soil. When the top layer of soil seems dry, water with small amounts of water and do not overwater the plant. Wilting leaves may be a sign of both too much and too little water. |
| Pruning | Occasionally prune the tree but take care not to cut off fruit-bearing twigs. |

## Harvesting:
Three to four years from a grafted tree. Avocado trees typically provide about 230-320 kilograms of fruit per year. The fruits ripen at different times, so harvest them as they become ripe.

## Curing:
Allow the avocados to ripen off the tree for about a week before consuming.

## Storage:
Store ripe avocados in the refrigerator for up to three days. Unripe avocados can be stored at room temperature until ripe, then moved to the refrigerator.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** 
- Branch Borer
- Fruit Fly

**Symptoms:** 
- **Branch Borer:** Causes severe damage to young nursery plants, resulting in plant death.
  
- **Fruit Fly:**
  - Due to the laying of eggs, the fruits show spots on the surface.
  - The infested fruits show an irregular shape, and then fall off.
  - When the fruit ripens, the larva develops and eats the flesh.
  - Scabs are formed at the damaged areas of the fruit and the harvest is wasted due to rotting in the fruit.

**Control method:** 
- **Branch Borer:**
  - Cut and burn dead parts of mature trees.
  - Use neem oil as an organic insecticide.
  
- **Fruit Fly:**
  - Setting pheromone traps for male flies.
  - Collect and bury or destroy infested fruits.
  - Apply paper covering at the tender stage.

### Disease Control
**Disease type:**
- Root rot
- Anthracnose
- Fruit rot

**Symptoms:**
- **Root rot:** Lives in the soil and damages new roots, the plant dies when the damage is severe.
  
- **Anthracnose:**
  - fruit and leaf damage under hot, humid weather conditions.
  - 1/2-inch circular spots appear on the fruit. The center of the spots is sunken and cracks are formed in the spots.
  - Purple spores are found in the spots during wet weather conditions.
    
- **Fruit rot:** May affect fruits after harvest. The outer bark and pith of the harvested fruits begin to rot near the stalk.
  
**Management:**
- **Root rot:**
  - Improve soil drainage
  - Apply soil fungicide to the area around the tree.
  - Mulching and sanitation
    
- **Anthracnose:** Controlled by applying fungicide containing copper.
  
- **Fruit rot:**
  - Pick the infected fruit along with the stalk, soak it in a suitable fungicide, and send it to the field.
  - Pruning of trees and dead branches.
  - Improve the sanitary conditions of the field by destroying the fruits that have fallen in the field due to crop residue, disease, and pest damage.

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Avocado trees grow best in the wet zones in Sri Lanka with an annual rainfall of 1200-1300mm. However, they require well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Requires well-draining deep loamy soil with a pH value of about 5.7
- Regular pruning and pest/disease management

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 8/10)
**Explanation:** Avocado trees can tolerate some drought but require regular watering for optimal growth in the dry zones.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Requires well-draining deep loamy soil with a pH value of about 5.7
- Regular watering to prevent wilting leaves

### Mid country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Avocado trees can grow in the mid countries but require more care due to varying temperatures and rainfall.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Requires well-draining deep loamy soil with a pH value of about 5.7
- Regular pruning, pest/disease management, and watering during dry periods

### Up country (Difficulty: 9/10)
**Explanation:** Avocado trees may struggle in the up countries due to cold temperatures.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Requires well-draining deep loamy soil with a pH value of about 5.7
- Protect from frost using methods such as mulching or covering young trees during cold periods
- Regular pruning, pest/disease management, and watering during dry periods
