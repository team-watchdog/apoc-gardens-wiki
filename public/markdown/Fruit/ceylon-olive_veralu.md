## Description
Elaeocarpus serratus is a tropical flowering plant in the family Elaeocarpaceae. It is a medium to large tree, with white flowers. It has a disjunctive distribution, with the species occurring in Sri Lanka and southern India, and in Assam, Bangladesh, and other parts in the north of the Indian subcontinent. The fruit is commonly eaten, and people also use the plant for ornamental, religious, and folk medicinal purposes. There are historical records of the use of plants in traditional medicine. 

It is a medium-sized tree that bears smooth ovoid green fruits about 2.5 cm long. Recommended varieties are local cultivars (round and oval fruits). It has a brown seed inside the fruit. The seed has a hard outer shell. The seeds are slow for germination and can take up to 2 years. The wood is whitish yellow.

## Planting requirements

**Planting season:** Tropical or subtropical climates are most suitable. 

### Planting conditions:
- Veralu is widespread throughout Sri Lanka but is more common in the wet zone and rarely found in dry regions. Flowering and fruiting occur in the dry season. Does not tolerate dry conditions and extreme cold
| Propagation | Direct seeding, budding, grafting. |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Direct seeding is possible but seeds are slow to germinate. Germination can take between 3 to 9 months. Cuttings about 4-6 inches long should be planted in nurseries and allowed to take root and then transplanted. Grafting is the more successful method of producing veralu plants. For that, the wedge grafting method is more suitable.  \n  \n Pits should be prepared with a distance of 2-3 meters between the plants for transplanting. Then the pits should be filled with a mixture made by mixing well-rotted dung or compost, topsoil, and sand in equal quantities.  
| Soil | Well-draining soil is ideal |
| Water | Must be watered regularly to maintain soil moisture. Do not overwater |
| Light | Partial sunlight in early stages of growth |

 
### Growing conditions:
| Temperatures | Ideally tropical or subtropical temperatures |
|----|----|
| Soil |  Well-draining soil is ideal |
| Water | Water regularly but do not overwater. Use soil moisture as a guide. |

## Harvesting:
8-9 years for direct seeded trees. 3-4 years for budded and grafted trees. A tree can produce between 60 to 100 kilograms of fruit every year. 

## Curing:
Veralu does not require a curing stage.

## Storage
Store fresh veralu in the refrigerator, ideally in a perforated plastic bag to allow airflow while maintaining humidity.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest Control
**Pest type:** Mature trees are not prone to pests; however, young saplings may attract leaf rollers.

**Symptoms:**
- **Leaf rollers:**

**Control method:**
- **Leaf rollers:** Organic insecticides are effective at controlling pests.

### Disease Control
Mature plants are not very susceptible to diseases.

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 3/10)
**Explanation:** Ceylon Olive thrives in the wet zone due to abundant rainfall and high humidity, which align well with its natural habitat preferences.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Monitor for potential waterlogging during heavy rains.
- Ensure proper drainage to prevent root rot.
- Regular pruning may be necessary to manage dense growth and improve air circulation.

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 8/10)
**Explanation:** Ceylon Olive struggles in the dry zone due to insufficient rainfall and extended dry periods, which are contrary to its preferred growing conditions.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Implement extensive irrigation systems to meet the plant's water requirements.
- Use mulching techniques to retain soil moisture.
- Provide shade or establish windbreaks to protect plants from extreme heat and desiccating winds.
- Consider intercropping with drought-resistant plants to create a more favorable microclimate.

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** The mid country offers moderate conditions for Ceylon Olive cultivation, with generally sufficient rainfall and suitable temperatures.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Supplement irrigation during drier periods to maintain consistent soil moisture.
- Amend soil in areas with poor drainage to ensure optimal growing conditions.
- Monitor young saplings for leaf roller infestations and apply organic insecticides if necessary.
- Implement proper spacing between trees to ensure adequate sunlight and air circulation.

### Up country (Difficulty: 8/10)
**Explanation:** Ceylon Olive faces challenges in the up country due to cooler temperatures and potential frost in higher elevations, which can affect growth and fruit production.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
* Protect from strong winds and frost, especially for young trees.
* Choose planting sites with maximum sun exposure to compensate for cooler temperatures.
* Consider using grafted varieties that may be more cold-tolerant.
* Be prepared for slower growth rates and potentially delayed fruiting compared to warmer zones.
