Its ends protrude slightly inwards. Fruits are seedless. Sometimes there may be 1-2 seeds. The juice is light yellow or light orange. Immature fruits are dark green and may turn light green or yellowish green when ripe.
Yellow Jamanaran: The rind is yellow, and peels easily. The fruit is seedless and weighs approx 120g. The tree reaches 1.5 meters in height and the leaf canopy spreads 1.5-2 meters in approx 4 years. Fruiting occurs in August – September and April – June. The Brix value, which measures sweetness, is only 12.1.
<update>
Bibile Sweet: A variety developed by the Department of Agriculture, well-suited for the dry and intermediate zones of Sri Lanka. It produces medium-sized fruits with a sweet flavor and few seeds.
</update>

## Planting requirements
- Citrus crops respond better to subtropical climatic conditions.  Jamanaran cultivation can be seen in both cold and dry climate zones: Uva, Central Provinces (Middle Zone), Indu variety is suitable for low country wet zone. 
**Planting season:** <update>February to March for the wet zone, July to August for the dry zone</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | It is very important to use a successful graft/transplant of a recommended type for planting. Aerate and thin the soil upto 5-10cm in depth. Create a small hole approx 5cm in depth. Fold the roots horizontally and place the plant in the hole and tighten the soil. |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Prepare the field to prevent soil erosion and wash-out. Prepare pits for planting at intervals of 3.5 – 4.0 meters. Each pit should be 75 X 75X 75 cm (width, length, height) in size. When digging pits, topsoil and subsoil should be piled separately.Expose the pits to sunlight for a few days. Pits should be filled with a mixture of well-digested organic matter and topsoil in a ratio of 1:1. Filling the pits in the form of a hill. Mark the center of each pit with a wedge. |
| Soil | Prepare the field to prevent soil erosion and wash-out. Prepare pits for planting at intervals of 3.5 – 4.0 meters. Each pit should be 75 X 75X 75 cm (width, length, height) in size. When digging pits, topsoil and subsoil should be piled separately.Expose the pits to sunlight for a few days. Pits should be filled with a mixture of well-digested organic matter and topsoil in a ratio of 1:1. Filling the pits in the form of a hill. Mark the center of each pit with a wedge. <update>Ensure soil pH is around 5-6 for optimal growth. In areas with heavy clay soil, add sand and organic matter to improve drainage.</update> |
| Water | <update>Water regularly, about once a week, depending on rainfall and weather conditions. During dry spells, increase watering frequency, especially for young trees.</update> |
| Light | It is important to provide shade to the plant for about 1-2 weeks. Use coconut fronds or shade nets for this. |

### Growing conditions:

| Temperatures | Recommended 25-32℃ <update>Avoid temperatures below 10℃. In up-country areas, provide frost protection during colder months.</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | A well-drained loamy soil rich in organic matter is ideal for cultivation. Also, the absence of gravel or hard soil in the soil up to a depth of about two meters is essential for the success of cultivation.The ideal soil pH for this crop is around 5-6. If the pH value is lower or higher than this, the cultivation is likely to be weakened due to toxicity and deficiencies of various elements. |
| Water | <update>Water as needed during the growing stage. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. In dry zones, consider mulching to retain soil moisture.</update> |
| Pruning | Flowering of trees is stimulated during one or two months of the year or when there is a short dry season. Grafting/Transplanting: Cut off the shoots below the graft junction, to prevent the formation of host plants. |

## Harvesting:
After about 2-3 years, the fruiting of the plant starts. Flowering usually occurs in late January to early February. This situation varies depending on the prevailing rainfall pattern. If there is too much fruiting, the fruits should be thinned by removing too large and too small fruits in clusters. When harvesting, the fruit stem should be as short as possible and not crushed. Harvest fruits at the correct ripening stage or the taste and quality may decrease. <update>Fruits are ready to harvest when they turn yellowish-green to orange. In Sri Lanka, main harvesting seasons are typically from August to October and February to April, depending on the region.</update>

## Curing:
N/A

## Storage
<update>Store fruits in a cool, dry place for up to 2 weeks. Avoid storing in plastic bags as it promotes rotting. For longer storage, keep in a well-ventilated area at temperatures between 8-10°C. In humid conditions, use newspaper to wrap individual fruits to prevent moisture accumulation.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:**
- Cancer and Tuberculosis-Bacteria <update>*Xanthomonas axonopodis* pv. citri</update>
- Fungal Diseases: Blood Membrane Disease, Gummy Blight (Pigiriaceae), Scab Disease (Cactaceae), Powdery mildew, Root Rot <update>(*Phytophthora parasitica*)</update>
- Viral Diseases: Tristessavirus Disease (Pagiri), Blight (Pigiri)
- Insect damage : Citrus Butterfly (Lime Butterfly), Leaf-eater, Black locust, Scale insects, Fruit fly, Fruit Boring Moths,

**Symptoms:** <update>
- Bacteria: Water-soaked spots on leaves and fruits that enlarge and turn brown or black.
- Fungi: Circular or irregular spots on leaves with yellow halos; powdery white patches on leaves and stems; root rot causes wilting and yellowing of leaves.
- Viruses: Mosaic patterns, ringspots, or yellowing on leaves; stunted growth; fruit drop.
- Insects: Holes in leaves; distorted leaves; sticky honeydew on leaves; presence of insects or their larvae.
</update>

**Control method:**
- Remove and burn diseased branches of trees
- Remove new leaves and reduce relative humidity <update>Maintain good air circulation around plants</update>
- Apply lime mixed with dung to the stem <update>(Not recommended due to potential burning of bark)</update>
- Provide appropriate shade <update>Avoid excessive shading as it can promote fungal diseases</update>
- Collect and burn fallen infected leaves
- improve drainage <update>Ensure soil is well-drained to prevent waterlogging</update>

### Disease Control
<update>
- Bacteria: Copper-based fungicides can be used. Spray when new growth begins in spring.
- Fungi: Apply fungicides containing copper, mancozeb, or chlorothalonil. Spray at intervals of 7-10 days during wet periods.
- Viruses: No chemical control available. Use virus-free planting material and practice good sanitation.
- Insects: Use insecticidal soaps, horticultural oils, or neem oil for soft-bodied insects. For harder pests like scale insects, use systemic insecticides.
