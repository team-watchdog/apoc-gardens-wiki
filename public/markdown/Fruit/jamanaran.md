## Description:

A popular citrus fruit cultivated in various regions of Sri Lanka, including the low country, mid-country, and up-country zones. This versatile fruit tree produces round to oval fruits with easy-to-peel skin and sweet, juicy segments that can be eaten fresh or used for juice production. Mandarin orange trees typically yield about 60 kg of fruit per year, with harvests spread throughout the year.

Mandarine fruit is also used for juices and seasonings. Essential oils from the peel are used in aromatherapy. Limomene, its most active ingredient, functions as a natural insect repellent, as well as an anti-bacterial solution

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** February to March for the wet zone, July to August for the dry zone

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Mandarins can be grown either from seed or from root stock/transplant. Grafting/Transplanting: Cut off the shoots below the graft junction, to prevent the formation of host plants |
|----|----|
| Planting method |  Germinate the plants indoors in a pot. Aerate and thin the soil upto 5-10cm in depth. Create a small hole approx 5cm in depth, then plant. For a root stock, fold the roots horizontally and place the plant in the hole and tighten the soil. Once it sprouts, move to an outdoor location with the soil prepared as per the section below |
| Soil | Prepare pits for planting at intervals of 3.5 – 4.0 meters. Each pit should be 75 X 75X 75 cm (width, length, height) in size. When digging pits, topsoil and subsoil should be piled separately. Expose the pits to sunlight for a few days. Pits should be filled with a mixture of well-digested organic matter and topsoil in a ratio of 1:1. Mark the center of each pit with a wedge. Ensure soil pH is around 5-6 for optimal growth. In areas with heavy clay soil, add sand and organic matter to improve drainage |
| Water | Water regularly, about once a week.|
| Light | It is important to provide shade to the plant for about 1-2 weeks. After this, the plant will require a lot of sunlight. |

### Growing conditions:

| Temperatures | Recommended 25-32℃. Avoid temperatures below 10℃. In up-country areas, provide protection during colder months. |
|----|----|
| Soil | A loose, well-drained loamy soil rich in organic matter is ideal for cultivation. Also, the absence of gravel or hard soil in the soil up to a depth of about two meters is essential for the success of cultivation. The ideal soil pH for this crop is around 5-6. If the pH value is lower or higher than this, the cultivation is likely to be weakened due to toxicity and deficiencies of various elements |
| Water | Water well once a week, or when the top 2-3 cm of the soil has become dry. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. In dry zones, consider mulching to retain soil moisture. During dry spells, increase watering frequency, especially for young trees |
| Pruning | Flowering of trees is stimulated during one or two months of the year or when there is a short dry season |
| Weed control | Weeding can enhance tree health and fruit production while minimizing competition for nutrients from unwanted plants |

## Harvesting:
After about 2-3 years, the fruiting of the plant starts. Flowering usually occurs in late January to early February. This situation varies depending on the prevailing rainfall pattern. If there is too much fruiting, the fruits should be thinned by removing too large and too small fruits in clusters. When harvesting, the fruit stem should be as short as possible and not crushed. Harvest fruits at the correct ripening stage or the taste and quality may decrease. Fruits are ready to harvest when they turn yellowish-green to orange. In Sri Lanka, main harvesting seasons are typically from August to October and February to April, depending on the region.

## Curing:
Mandarin does not require a curing stage.

## Storage
Store fruits in a cool, dry place for up to 2 weeks. Avoid storing in plastic bags as it promotes rotting. For longer storage, keep in a well-ventilated area at temperatures between 8-10°C. In humid conditions, use newspaper to wrap individual fruits to prevent moisture accumulation.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:**
- Citrus Butterfly (Papilio demoleus)
- Leaf Miner (Phyllocnistis citrella)
- Black Aphids (Toxoptera aurantii)
- Scale Insects
- Fruit Fly (Bactrocera kandiensis)

**Symptoms:**
- **Citrus Butterfly:** Caterpillars eat young leaves and shoots
- **Leaf Miner:** Silver streaks on young leaves, leaf distortion
- **Black Aphids:** Abundant on young stem parts and undersides of leaves, sap-sucking damage
- **Scale Insects:** Found on undersides of stems, young shoots, and fruit; cause yellowing and leaf shrinkage
- **Fruit Fly:** Larvae damage nuts and fruits, causing premature fruit drop

**Control method:**
- **Citrus Butterfly:** Hand-pick eggs and caterpillars, spray simple insecticide if necessary
- **Leaf Miner:** Remove damaged leaves, spray with suitable insecticide, use neem seed extract
