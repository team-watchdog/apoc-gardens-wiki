## Description:
Pomegranates are brownish-yellow to purplish-red berries 2‒5 in (5‒12 cm) in diameter with a smooth, leathery skin. Pomegranate leaves are glossy, dark green, oblong to oval, and 1‒1.25 in. (2.5‒3 cm) long. Leaves are arranged opposed and pairs alternately crossing at right angles and clustered on short branchlets.

Pomegranate is commercially important in Sri Lanka, with potential for both domestic consumption and export. The fruit can be consumed fresh or processed into various products such as juice, syrup, and wine.

Important pomegranate varieties cultivated in Sri Lanka include:
1. Kalpitiya hybrid: The first hybrid variety recommended by the Department of Agriculture, with red pulp, soft seeds, and high antioxidant properties.
2. Nimali: Medium-sized fruit with yellow bark, pink pulp, and soft seeds.
3. Daya: Similar to Nimali but with less colored pulp.
4. Nayana: Dark green leaves, thorny plant, and light pink fruit with harder seeds.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Year-round, but best during the dry season, May to September

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Propagated from hardwood cuttings |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Plant them with a spacing of 5-7 ft (1.5-2 m) between plants and 8-10 ft (2.5-3 m) between rows for smaller Sri Lankan varieties |
| Soil | Adapts well to Sri Lankan soil types, including sandy loam and lateritic soils. Prefers well-drained soil with a pH range of 5.5‒7.0 |
| Water | Should maintain adequate soil moisture. Requires consistent watering |
| Light | Requires full sunshine (at least 6 hours) |

### Growing conditions:

| Temperatures | Thrives in Sri Lanka's tropical climate with temperatures between 25-35°C |
|----|----|
| Soil | Add compost and mulch annually |
| Water | Should be irrigated every 5-7 days during dry periods. Drip irrigation or basin irrigation is preferred |
| Pruning | Prune in late dry season (August-September), removing dead or diseased wood and crossing branches |
| Weed control | Mulching helps suppress weeds. Hand-pulling or hoeing can also be used |

## Harvesting:
Harvesting occurs 5-7 months after flowering in Sri Lanka, typically from October to January

## Curing:
Pomegranates should be cured at room temperature for about a week to improve their flavor and texture.

## Storage
Store pomegranates in a cool, dry place for up to two weeks in Sri Lanka's climate. They can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one month.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest types:**
- Fruit flies
- Aphids
- Fruit borers

**Symptoms:**
- Holes in leaves or fruit
- Sticky honeydew on leaves
- Premature fruit drop

**Control methods:**
- Use neem oil
- Set up pheromone traps for fruit flies
- Maintain orchard hygiene
- Implement integrated pest management practices

### Disease Control
**Disease types:**
- Fruit spot
- Leaf spot
- Root rot

**Symptoms:**
- Brown spots on leaves or fruit
- Wilting
- Yellowing of leaves

**Management:**
- Avoid overhead watering
- Maintain good air circulation
- Remove infected plant material
- Use copper-based fungicides if necessary, following local agricultural guidelines

## Difficulty Rating

### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** High humidity increases the risk of fungal diseases, requiring more vigilant management and proper spacing for air circulation.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot. Consider planting on raised beds or mounds.
- Implement proper spacing to improve air circulation and reduce fungal diseases

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Pomegranates thrive in hot, dry climates, making this zone ideal with only minimal irrigation needed during dry periods.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide consistent watering during dry periods. Implement drip irrigation to conserve water.
- Monitor for signs of heat stress, such as wilting leaves.
- Use mulching to retain soil moisture and reduce water evaporation

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** This zone provides a good balance of temperature and rainfall.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Protect from extreme temperatures with mulching or windbreaks. Consider providing shade during peak heat hours.
- In areas with heavy rainfall, ensure proper drainage and consider planting on slopes

### Up country (Difficulty: 8/10)
**Explanation:** Cold temperatures and shorter growing seasons in high-altitude regions pose significant challenges, requiring careful variety selection and protective measures.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide protection from frost and strong winds. Consider growing in a greenhouse or using row covers during colder months.
- Ensure adequate sunlight exposure, as cloud cover can reduce light intensity at higher altitudes.
- Choose cold-hardy varieties suitable for higher elevations in Sri Lanka
- Implement terracing techniques to maximize sunlight exposure and improve drainage
