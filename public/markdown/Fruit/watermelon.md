# Watermelon

## General Information
**Generic name:** Citrullus lanatus
**Sri Lankan name:** Komadu (Sinhala)
**Scientific name:** Citrullus lanatus
**Plant family:** Cucurbitaceae
**Edible parts:** Fruit flesh, seeds, and rind after cooking
**Nutrition value:**
- High in water content
- Rich in vitamins A and C
- Contains lycopene, an antioxidant beneficial for heart health and prostate cancer prevention
**Companion plants:**
>Companion plants aid growth by attracting beneficial insects, repelling pests, and providing support. They are part of a natural pest control system, maximising space and increasing crop productivity.

- Corn: Improves soil moisture retention
- Beans: Fixes nitrogen in the soil
- Squash: Repels pests like cucumber beetles
**Non-companion plants:**
- Potatoes: Watermelons can inhibit potato growth due to allelopathy
- Fennel: May inhibit watermelon growth due to allelopathy

## Description:
Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is a flowering plant with a vine-like appearance native to Western Africa. Watermelon bears fruit that are widely cultivated and consumed across the world. Watermelon grow in tropical and temperate climates and requires warmth to grow. There are 1000 varieties around the world.

Watermelon is grown for its large edible fruit, which is a berry with a hard rind and no internal divisions, and is botanically called a pepo. The sweet, juicy flesh is usually deep red to pink, with many black seeds, although seedless varieties exist. The fruit can be eaten raw or pickled, and the rind is edible after cooking. It may also be consumed as a juice or an ingredient in mixed beverages.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>Best planted during the Yala season (March to August) in Sri Lanka</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Direct seeding, approximately 3 kilograms per hectare |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Plant seeds between ½ and 1 inch deep based on soil moisture. The more moisture in the soil, the shallower the seeds should be planted.<br>Plant 3-4 seeds in each pit. Maintain a distance of half a meter between pits and one meter between rows. Depending on the temperature of the soil, the time taken for the seeds to germinate is about 07 to 10 days. If the temperature of the soil is low, the time taken for the germination of the seeds also increases. Ensure soil temperature is consistently above 60°F (15°C) for optimal germination. |
| Soil | Well draining, sandy or loamy soil rich in organic matter with a pH value from 5.5-7.0 <update>Lateritic soils common in Sri Lanka are suitable when amended with organic matter</update> |
| Water | Water regularly and ensure soil is moist. However do not overwater to the extent that soil becomes waterlogged. Avoid overhead watering to prevent fungal diseases. |
| Light | Full or partial sunlight |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | 21 to 30 degrees celsius Ideal daytime temperature is between 85-95°F (29-35°C). Nighttime temperatures should not drop below 60°F (15°C). |
|----|----|
| Soil | Keep soil moist but well drained |
| Water | Water regularly but reduce irrigation as fruits begin to ripen Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. |
| Pruning | Regular pruning of the plants is necessary Prune side shoots and remove diseased leaves to maintain plant health. |
| Weed control | Maintain weed-free conditions around plants |

## Harvesting:
First harvest between 75 and 80 days of planting. Final harvest between 100 and 110 days of planting. Well managed fields have provided yields of between 15-20 tonnes per acre over the entire growth cycle. Harvest watermelons when they are fully ripe. The underside will turn from white to yellow, and the rind will become tougher.

## Curing:
Harvest watermelons when they are fully ripe. Store at room temperature for up to two weeks or refrigerate for up to three months. Cured watermelons can be stored at room temperature for about 10-14 days or refrigerated for about 2-3 weeks.

## Storage
Store watermelons in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. They can be stored at room temperature for about 10-14 days or refrigerated for about 2-3 weeks. For best results, store watermelons between 50-60°F (10-15°C).

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Leaf beetles, sap sucking insects, fruit spot, brown spot

**Symptoms:**
- Leaf beetles cause holes in leaves
- Sap sucking insects cause wilting and yellowing of leaves
- Fruit spot causes dark spots on the fruit rind
- Brown spot causes brown patches on leaves

**Control method:** Regular pruning of the plants is necessary. In the event of spotting remove infected parts of the plant. Organic insecticides are effective at warding off beetles and sap sucking insects. Introduce natural predators like ladybugs to control pests. <update>Use neem oil spray as an organic pesticide option</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** Anthracnose, fusarium wilt, powdery mildew

**Symptoms:**
- Anthracnose causes dark spots on leaves, stems, and fruit rind
- Fusarium wilt causes yellowing of lower leaves and wilting of plants
- Powdery mildew causes white patches on leaves

**Management:** Maintain good air circulation around plants. Avoid overhead watering to prevent fungal diseases. Use fungicides as a last resort. Apply a mixture of baking soda and water to control powdery mildew. <update>Rotate crops to prevent soil-borne diseases</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Watermelons can be grown in the low country wet zone with proper irrigation and management of pests and diseases.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging
- Monitor for and manage pests and diseases
<update>- Use raised beds to improve drainage during heavy monsoon rains</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Watermelons can be grown in the low country dry zone with adequate irrigation.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure consistent moisture levels in soil
- Protect plants from strong winds Provide shade during peak hours to prevent heat stress.
<update>- Implement drip irrigation to conserve water in dry conditions</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Watermelons can be grown in the mid country with careful management of temperature and water requirements.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Maintain optimal temperatures between 21 to 30 degrees celsius
- Ensure consistent moisture levels in soil Mulch around plants to retain soil moisture.
- Protect plants from sudden temperature changes
<update>- Use plastic mulch to warm soil in cooler areas</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 8/10)
**Explanation:** Watermelons can be grown in the up country with careful management of temperature and water requirements.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Maintain optimal temperatures between 21 to 30 degrees celsius
- Ensure consistent moisture levels in soil Install a drip irrigation system for efficient watering.
- Protect plants from frost Use row covers or cloches during cold nights.
<update>- Choose short-season varieties adapted to cooler climates</update>
