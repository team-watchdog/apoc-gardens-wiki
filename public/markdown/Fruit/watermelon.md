## Description:
Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is a flowering plant with a vine-like appearance native to Western Africa. Watermelon bears fruit that are widely cultivated and consumed across the world. Watermelon grow in tropical and temperate climates and requires warmth to grow. There are 1000 varieties around the world.

Watermelon is grown for its large edible fruit, which is a berry with a hard rind and no internal divisions, and is botanically called a pepo. The sweet, juicy flesh is usually deep red to pink, with many black seeds, although seedless varieties exist. The fruit can be eaten raw or pickled, and the rind is edible after cooking. It may also be consumed as a juice or an ingredient in mixed beverages.

## Varieties
According to botanical characteristics, watermelon varieties can be divided into two main groups:
1. Sweet Melon: Types with more sweetness, including Musk Melon, Rock Melon, and Cantaloupe.
2. Water Melon: The common type in Sri Lanka, with less sweetness and higher water content in the pulp.

The "Thilini" variety, introduced by the Department of Agriculture, has become very popular in Sri Lanka. It's known as "Sugar Baby" in the foreign market. "Thilini" can withstand dry conditions better than other varieties. It produces dark green, round fruits that are almost uniform in size, weighing about 2.5-3.0 kg. The pulp of well-ripened fruits is delicious and pink-red in color.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Best planted during the Yala season (March to August) in Sri Lanka

##### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Direct seeding |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Plant seeds 20mm (about 1 inch) deep. The more moisture in the soil, the shallower the seeds should be planted.<br>Plant 3-4 seeds in each pit. Maintain a distance of half a meter between pits and one meter between rows. Seeds should germinate in around 10-14 days at a soil temperature of 27-32°C (80-90°F).<br>For home gardens, consider planting in mounds or hills about 1 meter square and 30cm high, with groups of seeds spaced about 30cm apart. This method allows for better drainage and soil warming.<br>After germination, thin to the strongest 1-2 plants per group. |
| Soil | Well-draining, sandy or loamy soil rich in organic matter with a pH value from 5.5-7.0. Lateritic soils common in Sri Lanka are suitable when amended with organic matter. Prepare soil by weeding thoroughly, digging it over to loosen, and adding aged animal manure or compost. |
| Water | Keep soil moist but never wet or dry. Water deeply in the early morning or late afternoon. Avoid watering the leaves to prevent fungal diseases. |
| Light | Full sun. Choose a location that will receive at least 6 hours of full sun each day. |
| Space | Allow at least 2 square meters per plant if growing on the ground. If space is limited, consider growing on a strong trellis, though this requires more effort. |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Ideal daytime temperature is between 20-32°C (68-90°F). Nighttime temperatures should not drop below 16°C (60°F). |
|----|----|
| Soil | Keep soil moist but well-drained. Mulch around plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds, but wait until plants have outgrown the vulnerable seedling stage. |
| Water | Water regularly but reduce irrigation as fruits begin to ripen. Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. Ensure consistent moisture, especially during fruit development. |
| Pruning | When vines are about 2 meters long, pinch out the tips to encourage branching. Remove side shoots and diseased leaves to maintain plant health. After several fruits have set on a branch, you can pinch out the tip of that branch to focus energy on fruit development. |
| Weed control | Maintain weed-free conditions around plants. Use mulch to suppress weeds and avoid disturbing shallow roots when weeding. |
| Fertilizer | Watermelons are heavy feeders. If soil was well-prepared, no extra fertilizer may be necessary. In poor soil, apply a balanced fertilizer or one formulated for fruits and vegetables. Use a high-nitrogen fertilizer in early stages, then switch to a high-potassium fertilizer once flowering begins. Organic options like pelleted chicken manure work well. |
| Pollination | Watermelons have separate male and female flowers on the same plant. If fruit isn't setting, you may need to hand-pollinate. Do this early in the morning by transferring pollen from male flowers to female flowers using a small brush or by removing the male flower and touching its center to the center of the female flower. |
## Harvesting:
First harvest between 75 and 80 days of planting. Final harvest between 100 and 110 days of planting. Well managed fields have provided yields of between 15-20 tonnes per acre over the entire growth cycle. Harvest watermelons when they are fully ripe. Signs of ripeness include:
- The underside turning from white to yellow
- The rind becoming tougher
- A dull thud sound when tapped
- The place where the fruit touches the ground turning yellow
- For the Thilini variety, the fruit starting to turn gray

## Storage
Store watermelons in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. They can be stored at room temperature for about 10-14 days or refrigerated for about 2-3 weeks. For best results, store watermelons between 50-60°F (10-15°C).

For export, wash the fruits in cold water, gradually cool them, and pack in cardboard boxes.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Leaf beetles, sap sucking insects, fruit spot, brown spot

**Symptoms:**
- Leaf beetles cause holes in leaves
- Sap sucking insects cause wilting and yellowing of leaves
- Fruit spot causes dark spots on the fruit rind
- Brown spot causes brown patches on leaves

**Control method:** Regular pruning of the plants is necessary. In the event of spotting remove infected parts of the plant. Organic insecticides are effective at warding off beetles and sap sucking insects. Introduce natural predators like ladybugs to control pests. Use neem oil spray as an organic pesticide option.

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** Anthracnose, fusarium wilt, powdery mildew, downy mildew, bacterial leaf blight, leaf spot virus

**Symptoms:**
- Anthracnose causes dark spots on leaves, stems, and fruit rind
- Fusarium wilt causes yellowing of lower leaves and wilting of plants
- Powdery mildew causes white patches on leaves
- Downy mildew can infect vines at fruiting time, especially in wet weather
- Bacterial leaf blight causes yellow-brown spots on leaves
- Leaf spot virus causes yellow spots and leaf deformation

**Management:** 
- Maintain good air circulation around plants
- Avoid overhead watering to prevent fungal diseases
- Use fungicides as a last resort
- Apply a mixture of baking soda and water to control powdery mildew
- Rotate crops to prevent soil-borne diseases
- Remove and destroy diseased plants
- Use disease-resistant varieties when available
- Apply appropriate prescribed fungicides when necessary
