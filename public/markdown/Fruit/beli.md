## Description:
Aegle marmelos is a rare species of tree native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It is present in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal as a naturalized species. It is a deciduous shrub or small to medium-sized tree, up to 13 metres (43 feet) tall with slender drooping branches and a rather open, irregular crown.

The fruit typically has a diameter of between 5 and 10 cm (2 and 4 in). It is globose or slightly pear-shaped with a thick, hard rind and does not split upon ripening. The woody shell is smooth and green, gray until it is fully ripe when it turns yellow. Inside are 8 to 15 or 20 sections filled with aromatic orange pulp, each section with 6 to 10 flattened-oblong seeds each about 1 cm long, bearing woolly hairs and each enclosed in a sac of adhesive, transparent mucilage that solidifies on drying. The exact number of seeds varies in different publications.

The fruit takes about 9-12 months to ripen on the tree, reaching maturity in December. It can reach the size of a large grapefruit or pomelo, and some are even larger. The shell is so hard it must be cracked with a hammer or machete. The fibrous yellow pulp is very aromatic. It has been described as tasting of marmalade and smelling of roses.

## Planting requirements
<update>**Planting season:** February to April</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | direct seeding, cuttings, grafting, or root cuttings |
|----|----|
| Planting method | After separating the seeds from the ripe fruits, they should be washed thoroughly with water and then they should be planted in a nursery. Germination will start in about 8-10 days. Once the seedlings sprout two or three leaves, transplant to pots or polythene containers with a mixture of equal parts top soil, sand, and dung. In 9-12 months, the potted plants will be ready for transplanting to the field. |
| Soil | Grows well under different climatic conditions as well as in very infertile soil and very fertile soil. Beli grows uniformly even in soil with pH varying from 5-10 (strongly alkaline). Grows best in well-drained soils. |
| Water | Does not require regular watering once germination is complete, rainfall should be adequate. Monitor soil moisture but do not overwater. |
| Light | Full or partial sunlight |

### Growing conditions:

| Temperatures | 25-35 degrees celsius is ideal |
|----|----|
| Soil | Ensure that soil is well-drained |
| Water | Rainfall provides sufficient water. Monitor soil moisture |
| Pruning | Prune in late winter to early spring to encourage new growth and maintain shape. |
| Weed control | Mulching helps suppress weeds and retains soil moisture. |

## Harvesting:
Trees grown from seeding will take 7-9 years to bear fruit. Trees grown from cuttings or grafting will bear fruit in 3-5 years. Fruits take about 9-12 months to ripen. Only pluck the fruit once it has ripened as it will cease ripening once removed from the tree. Older trees typically have higher yields. A 15 year old tree should provide a harvest of between 200-400 fruits.

<update>
## Curing:
The fruit can be cured by leaving it to ripen on the tree until it turns yellow, then storing it in a cool, dry place for about a month.

## Storage
Ripe Beli fruits can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 weeks. For longer storage, they can be refrigerated for up to 4 months.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Older trees are rarely afflicted by disease or pest infestations but saplings maybe susceptible to various fungal infections and insect infestations.
<update>**Symptoms:** Wilting leaves, yellowing leaves, holes in leaves, sticky honeydew on leaves.</update>
**Control method:** Organic pesticides are effective at pest control. Remove diseased parts of the plant in the case of fungal infections. Fungicide maybe required.

### Disease Control
<update>
**Disease type:** Bacterial leaf spot, anthracnose
**Symptoms:** Water-soaked spots on leaves that enlarge and turn brown or black with a yellow halo.
**Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, remove infected plant material, use copper-based fungicides as a last resort.
</update>
## Difficulty Rating

### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Beli trees can tolerate high humidity and rainfall but are susceptible to fungal diseases in wet conditions.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- **Fungal infections:** Monitor plants for signs of disease and treat promptly with fungicides.

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Beli trees are drought-tolerant once established but require regular watering during the dry season.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- **Drought:** Ensure consistent moisture during the dry season, especially for young plants.

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Beli trees grow well in the mid-country climate with moderate temperatures and rainfall.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- **Temperature fluctuations:** Provide protection from extreme temperature fluctuations, especially during flowering.

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Beli trees can tolerate cold temperatures but are susceptible to frost damage. They may require protection in high-altitude areas.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- **Frost:** Provide frost protection for young plants and during flowering.
