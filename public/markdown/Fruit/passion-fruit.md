- Basil: Attracts pollinators and can help repel some pests, benefiting nearby passion fruit plants.
- Lemongrass: Acts as a natural pest repellent, protecting nearby passion fruit vines.
- Pineapple: Shares similar soil and climate preferences with passion fruit and doesn't compete for vertical space.
- Lime: Citrus trees can complement passion fruit in mixed orchards, sharing similar care requirements without direct competition.
- Banana: Can provide partial shade and wind protection for young passion fruit vines.
- Papaya: Grows well alongside passion fruit and can provide some wind protection without excessive shading.

**Non-Companion Plants:**

- Corn: Competes heavily for nutrients and can overshadow passion fruit vines.
- Cowpea: May attract pests that could also affect passion fruit plants.
- Sorghum: Competes for resources and can potentially overshadow passion fruit vines.
- Sweet potatoes: Compete for space and nutrients with passion fruit's shallow root system.
- Okra: May share similar pests with passion fruit, potentially increasing pest problems.
- Cassava: Its deep roots can compete with passion fruit for soil nutrients and water.
- Taro: Prefers wetter conditions that could lead to root rot in passion fruit plants.
- Yam: Large tubers can disrupt the soil structure needed for healthy passion fruit roots.
- Breadfruit: Large trees that provide too much shade for sun-loving passion fruit vines.
- Jackfruit: Creates excessive shade and root competition for passion fruit.
- Mango: While it can provide support, it may create too much shade and root competition as it matures.
- Coconut: Tall palms may provide too much shade and compete for nutrients in the long term.
- Guava: Can compete for nutrients and may share pest issues with passion fruit.


## Description:
Passion fruit is a climbing vine with large, three-lobed leaves, tendrils for climbing, and beautiful flowers. There are two main varieties of passion fruit. The fruit is either yellow or purple depending on the variety, round or oval in shape, with a smooth, thick, pithy rind, filled with sweet, aromatic pulp, juice, and seeds.

In Sri Lanka, the purple variety (Passiflora edulis f. edulis) is more common, though the yellow variety (Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa) is also grown. The fruits are round or oval, with a hard, waxy rind enclosing an aromatic pulp filled with small, edible seeds.

Several varieties are recommended for cultivation in Sri Lanka:

1. **Horana Gold**: Suitable for wet, intermediate, and dry regions. It produces high yields with an average fruit weight of about 135 grams. The pulp and rind are yellowish-orange, and fruits are round or oblong in shape.

2. **Bandarawela Dham**: Recommended for mid-upland and upland wet zones. It has a reddish-purple rind and fruits weighing between 100-120 grams. This variety is moderately resistant to viruses and root rot diseases.

3. **Rahangala hybrid**: A hybrid of yellow and purple varieties, producing pinkish-purple fruits with high juice quality. It is recommended for upland areas.

The economic life of a passion fruit plantation is typically about 5 years, with maximum yield obtained after 3 years. Regarding yield, the first harvest can usually be obtained about 10 months after planting. For example, the Bandarawela Dham variety can yield approximately 16 kg per vine in the first year and 24 kg in the second year.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** 
Year-round in most parts of Sri Lanka, but best planted at the onset of the rainy season (May-June or October-November)

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Extract seeds from the fruit and rub them between a sheet of sandpaper. Soak overnight for 12 hours. For germination, bury your seed in a container filled with a small amount of soil or seed-raising mix about an inch deep. When your seedling is roughly 4 inches high, re-pot your plant in a larger pot, around 6-8 inches in diameter. In Sri Lanka, stem cuttings are also commonly used for propagation. |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Plant seeds directly into the ground after soaking overnight. For stem cuttings, plant directly in well-prepared soil.
| Soil | Requires well-drained fertile soils/compost-rich, sandy loam. A soil pH of 5.5 to 6.5 is optimal
| Water | Requires lot of water but cannot handle waterlogged soil. So make sure the soil is well drained
| Light | Needs full sunshine

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Thrives in Sri Lanka's tropical climate with temperatures between 20-30Â°C |
|----|----|
| Soil | Can handle lots of compost and lots of mulch
| Water | Need to provide regular watering especially during dry periods
| Pruning | Prune in late winter or early spring to encourage new growth. In Sri Lanka, light pruning can be done year-round to maintain shape and productivity.
| Weed control | Mulching helps control weeds. Hand-pull or use organic herbicides for persistent weeds.

## Harvesting:
In Sri Lanka, passion fruit can be harvested year-round, with peak seasons typically occurring twice a year. Fruits are ready when they turn from green to purple or yellow (depending on variety) and fall to the ground.

## Curing:
Passion fruit does not require curing. It can be eaten fresh or used in juices and desserts.

## Storage
Store passion fruit at room temperature for up to a week, or refrigerate for up to two weeks. In Sri Lanka's humid climate, refrigeration is recommended for longer storage. Local markets often sell freshly harvested fruits for immediate consumption.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** 
Snails, Slugs, passion butterfly, nematodes, fruit flies, mealy bugs, scale insects, red spider mites

**Symptoms:** Holes in leaves, fruit damage, wilting, premature fruit drop

**Control method:** Remove diseased plant/fruit, cover the mature fruit with paper or a mesh, use organic pesticides for insects and neem oil for fungal diseases. Implement integrated pest management techniques, including the use of pheromone traps for fruit flies.

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** Passion fruit woodiness virus, collar rot, brown spot

**Symptoms:** Wilting, yellowing leaves, fruit rot, woody and deformed fruits

**Management:** Avoid overhead watering, provide good air circulation, use fungicides as a last resort. Use disease-resistant varieties and practice crop rotation.

## Difficulty Rating

### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Passion fruit thrives in this zone due to high rainfall and humidity, but disease management is crucial.
- **Challenges/Adaptations:**
  - Regular monitoring for pests and diseases
  - Providing good air circulation
  - Implementing proper drainage systems

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Irrigation is essential in this zone, but the drier conditions can help prevent some fungal diseases.
- **Challenges/Adaptations:**
  - Ensuring consistent watering to prevent heat stress
  - Providing shade during peak hours
  - Mulching to conserve soil moisture

### Mid country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** This zone offers ideal conditions for passion fruit cultivation with moderate temperatures and rainfall.
- **Challenges/Adaptations:**
  - Managing excess rainfall during monsoon seasons
  - Providing adequate drainage to prevent waterlogging
  - Implementing trellising systems for optimal growth

### Up country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Cooler temperatures in this zone can slow growth, but passion fruit can still be cultivated with proper care.
- **Challenges/Adaptations:**
  - Protecting plants from cold winds and frost
  - Using greenhouses or poly-tunnels for temperature control
  - Providing consistent watering to prevent drought stress
