## Description:
Passion fruit is a climbing vine with large, three-lobed leaves, tendrils for climbing, and beautiful flowers. There are two main varieties of passion fruit. The fruit is either yellow or purple depending on the variety, round or oval in shape, with a smooth, thick, pithy rind, filled with sweet, aromatic pulp, juice, and seeds.

In Sri Lanka, the purple variety (_Passiflora edulis f. edulis_) is more common, though the yellow variety (_Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa_) is also grown. The fruits are round or oval, with a hard, waxy rind enclosing an aromatic pulp filled with small, edible seeds.

Several varieties are recommended for cultivation in Sri Lanka:
1. **Horana Gold**: Suitable for wet, intermediate, and dry regions. It produces high yields with an average fruit weight of about 135 grams. The pulp and rind are yellowish-orange, and fruits are round or oblong in shape.

2. **Bandarawela Dham**: Recommended for mid-upland and upland wet zones. It has a reddish-purple rind and fruits weighing between 100-120 grams. This variety is moderately resistant to viruses and root rot diseases.

3. **Rahangala hybrid**: A hybrid of yellow and purple varieties, producing pinkish-purple fruits with high juice quality. It is recommended for upland areas.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** 
Year-round in most parts of Sri Lanka, but best planted at the onset of the rainy season, May-June or October-November

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Seeds and Stem cuttings |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Extract seeds from the fruit and rub them between a sheet of sandpaper. Soak overnight for 12 hours. For germination, bury your seed in a container filled with a small amount of soil or seed-raising mix about an inch deep. When your seedling is roughly 4 inches high, re-pot your plant in a larger pot, around 6-8 inches in diameter. In Sri Lanka, stem cuttings are also commonly used for propagation |
| Soil | Requires well-drained fertile soils/compost-rich, sandy loam. A soil pH of 5.5 to 6.5 is optimal |
| Water | Requires lot of water but cannot handle waterlogged soil. So make sure the soil is well drained |
| Light | Needs full sunshine |

### Growing conditions:

| Temperatures | Thrives in Sri Lanka's tropical climate with temperatures between 20-30Â°C |
|----|----|
| Soil | Can handle lots of compost and lots of mulch |
| Water | Need to provide regular watering especially during dry periods |
| Pruning | Prune to encourage new growth. Light pruning can be done year-round to maintain shape and productivity |
| Weed control | Mulching helps control weeds. Hand-pull or use organic herbicides for persistent weeds |

## Harvesting:
In Sri Lanka, passion fruit can be harvested year-round, with peak seasons typically occurring twice a year. Fruits are ready when they turn from green to purple or yellow (depending on variety) and fall to the ground.

The first harvest can usually be obtained about 10 months after planting. For example, the Bandarawela Dham variety can yield approximately 16 kg per vine in the first year and 24 kg in the second year.

## Curing:
Passion fruit does not require curing. It can be eaten fresh or used in juices and desserts.

## Storage
Store passion fruit at room temperature for up to a week, or refrigerate for up to two weeks. In Sri Lanka's humid climate, refrigeration is recommended for longer storage.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest types:**
- Red Scale
- Mealybugs
- Passionvine Mite
- Root-Knot Nematodes
- Thrips
- Aphids
- Scales

**Symptoms:**
- Red Scale: Yellowing leaves, stunted growth
- Mealybugs: White cottony masses on leaves and stems, sooty mold
- Passionvine Mite: Yellowing leaves, brown blemishes on fruit
- Root-Knot Nematodes: Thickened roots with knots, stunted plant growth
- Aphids: Malformation in foliage
- Thrips: Stunting of young seedlings, defaced leaves and fruits
- Scales: Encrusted leaves, branches, and fruits

**Control methods:**
- Cultural Practices: Use resistant varieties, maintain good drainage, practice crop rotation
- Chemical Control: Insecticides for severe infestations of mealybugs and fruit flies
- Biological Control: Introduce natural predators like ladybugs for aphids and mealybugs
- Physical Removal: Hand-picking of pests like caterpillars and regular monitoring
- Avoid high levels of nitrogen (for aphids)
- Release natural aphid predators like Chrysoperla zastrowii sillemi
- Spray white oil or horticultural oil for severe scale infestations
- Conserve or release populations of Aphytis spp. for scale control

### Disease Control
**Disease types:**
- Anthracnose (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides)
- Fusarium Wilt (Fusarium spp.)
- Brown Spot (Alternaria passiflorae)
- Phytophthora Blight (Phytophthora spp.)
- Passionfruit Woodiness Virus

**Symptoms:**
- Anthracnose: Dark brown spots on leaves, wilting, and fruit rot
- Fusarium Wilt: Yellowing of leaves followed by wilting and death of the plant
- Brown Spot: Reddish-brown lesions on leaves and fruits, leading to defoliation
- Phytophthora Blight: Water-soaked lesions on stems and roots; can lead to plant collapse
- Passionfruit Woodiness Virus: Hardening of fruits

**Management:**
- Cultural Practices: Use disease-free seedlings, improve air circulation by pruning, avoid overhead watering
- Chemical Control: Fungicides such as copper compounds for fungal diseases
- Sanitation: Remove infected plant debris and avoid planting in previously infected areas

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Passion fruit thrives in this zone due to high rainfall and humidity, but disease management is crucial.
- **Challenges/Adaptations:**
  - Regular monitoring for pests and diseases
  - Providing good air circulation
  - Implementing proper drainage systems

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Irrigation is essential in this zone, but the drier conditions can help prevent some fungal diseases.
- **Challenges/Adaptations:**
  - Ensuring consistent watering to prevent heat stress
  - Providing shade during peak hours
  - Mulching to conserve soil moisture

### Mid country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** This zone offers ideal conditions for passion fruit cultivation with moderate temperatures and rainfall.
- **Challenges/Adaptations:**
  - Managing excess rainfall during monsoon seasons
  - Providing adequate drainage to prevent waterlogging
  - Implementing trellising systems for optimal growth

### Up country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Cooler temperatures in this zone can slow growth, but passion fruit can still be cultivated with proper care.
- **Challenges/Adaptations:**
  - Protecting plants from cold winds and frost
  - Using greenhouses or poly-tunnels for temperature control
  - Providing consistent watering to prevent drought stress
