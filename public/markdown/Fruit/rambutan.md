## Description:
A tree of the soapberry family (Sapindaceae), Rambutan grows best in tropical climates and yields edible fruit. It attracts bees and other pollinators and its fruit has a pleasant aroma. The bright-red, oval fruit is covered with long, soft spines and has a tasty acid pulp. The tree grows to about 10.5–12 metres (35–40 feet). Recommended varieties for cultivation in Sri Lanka: Malwana Special, Malayan Red, Malayan Yellow.
Other varieties available in Sri Lanka which are not recommended: Java Special, Java Labukabola, Java Simadjan, Java Seedless, Java Sinjanjan, 

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** 
Planting should be done with the onset of monsoon. 
<update>Planting should be done at the beginning of the monsoon season, typically in May or October in Sri Lanka.</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Grafting/Transplanting. It is not possible to reach a firm conclusion about the quality of the fruits of the plants produced by planting seedlings. Therefore, planting seedlings is not recommended. |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Carefully remove the polythene cover so as not to damage the roots and plant the soil in the center of the hole without spilling. Plant a support near the plant and place the plant on it and tie it carefully. It is necessary to provide shade during the initial period of planting in the field |
| Soil | Mark the spacing between plants as 10 x 10 or 10 x 8 meters and dig pits of 60 x 60 x 60 cm (length, width, height). Fill the holes with the recommended mixture of fertilizers and compost. pH of 5.5 to 6.5 is perfect and they won't do well in soil that is too acidic or alkaline. |
| Water | <update>In Sri Lanka's climate, regular watering is crucial, especially during dry spells. Ensure consistent moisture, particularly during fruit development stages.</update> |
| Light | When planting transplants in permanent ground, shading is very important to prevent scorching of young plants from strong sunlight. Coconut branches can be used to build shades for the young plants. |

### Growing conditions:

| Temperatures | <update>Ambient temperature 27 – 30C, which is typical in Sri Lanka's lowland and midland regions</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | Well-drained loamy soil is ideal for cultivation. Apart from this, the soil depth of 2-3 meters also affects the success of cultivation. |
| Water | <update>Rainfall between 1500 – 2000mm required, which is common in Sri Lanka's wet and intermediate zones. Areas with relative humidity of 75% – 80% are favorable for rambutan cultivation, typical of many parts of Sri Lanka.</update> |

## Harvesting:
<update>In Sri Lanka, the first harvest from a grafted rambutan tree can be seen in 3-4 years. It takes 7-8 years to get a high economic yield. In the lowland and midland wet zones, harvesting typically takes place between June and August, and in the intermediate zone it is from January to March. Harvesting may vary slightly due to weather changes.</update>

A well-managed mature rambutan tree can yield about 200 kg (6000 fruits) per year.

The best time to harvest rambutan is when its characteristic color is seen in the fruits. Rambutan does not ripen further when it is plucked from the tree. Therefore, rambutan should be harvested at the right time to send it to the market. Cluster harvesting is useful as it provides some pruning.

## Curing:
<update>After harvesting, cure rambutan by placing them in a single layer on a tray and storing them in a cool, dry place for about 5-7 days. This helps to reduce moisture content and improves shelf life.</update>

## Storage
<update>Store cured rambutan at temperatures between 10-15°C (50-59°F) with high humidity levels (85-90%) for up to 2 weeks. In Sri Lanka, where ambient temperatures are often higher, refrigeration is crucial for extending shelf life.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** <update>Animals like squirrels, crows, monkeys and bats | Insects: Piti Makuna, worms, fruit flies, Stem borer beetle (Risk of insect damage is mostly post harvest) | Pitipus disease</update>

**Symptoms:** Animals: Damage to fruits and branches. Insects: Holes in leaves and fruits, sticky honeydew on leaves. Pitipus disease: Yellowing leaves, wilting, and eventual death of branches.

**Control method:**
- Weeds within a 1 meter radius around the trees can be controlled by uprooting or using a hoe. Weed control twice a year is sufficient.
- Animal pest control: Lighting the trees at night, windchimes, install bird netting.
- Insect control: Keep the harvest clean, Applying grease around the trunk about 2 feet above the main trunk of the tree can prevent mealybugs from being carried by ants while reapplying every week, Cover rambutan bunches with perforated paper or polythene sheets when ripening begins, Remove rambutan fruits that have fallen under the trees and agitate the soil around the tree,
- Pitipus disease: Prune unnecessary branches so that sunlight and ventilation can enter the plant canopy, Remove and destroy infected parts of the trees from the previous season, Apply fungicides containing copper or mancozeb

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** Bacterial leaf spot, Anthracnose

**Symptoms:** Bacterial leaf spot: Water-soaked spots on leaves that enlarge and turn brown with a yellow halo. Anthracnose: Dark brown to black spots on fruits and leaves with a purple margin.

**Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, remove infected plant material, apply copper-based fungicides or bactericides

## Difficulty Ratings for Rambutan Cultivation in Sri Lanka's Climate Zones
### 1. **Lowland Wet Zone (Southwestern Sri Lanka)**
- *Difficulty Rating:* 6/10
- *Explanation:* The lowland wet zone has suitable temperatures (27-30°C) and high rainfall (2500-5000mm), but the excessive humidity can increase the risk of diseases like Anthracnose. Regular pruning, fungicide application, and disease management are crucial.

### 2. **Midland Wet Zone (Central Sri Lanka)**
- *Difficulty Rating:* 5/10
- *Explanation:* The midland wet zone has adequate rainfall (1500-2500mm) and suitable temperatures for rambutan cultivation. However, the cooler climate may affect flowering and fruiting, requiring careful management of dry periods.

### 3. **Intermediate Zone (North-Central & Uva Provinces)**
- *Difficulty Rating:* 7/10
- *Explanation:* The intermediate zone has lower rainfall (500-1500mm) than ideal but can be supplemented with irrigation. Temperatures are suitable, but the drier climate increases the risk of drought stress and pest infestations like fruit flies.

### 4. **Dry Zone (North & Eastern Sri Lanka)**
- *Difficulty Rating:* 8/10
- *Explanation:* The dry zone has insufficient rainfall (<500mm) and higher temperatures (>30°C), making it challenging to grow rambutan successfully without adequate irrigation. Regular watering, pest control, and disease management are essential.

Each climate zone requires careful management of water, pests, diseases, and temperature fluctuations for successful rambutan cultivation. However, with proper care, rambutan can be grown in all four zones, with varying levels of difficulty.
