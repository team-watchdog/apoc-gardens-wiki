## Description:
A pitaya is the fruit of several different cactus species indigenous to the region of southern Mexico and along the Pacific coasts of Guatemala, Costa Rica, and El Salvador. Pitaya is cultivated in East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the United States, the Caribbean, Australia, and throughout tropical and subtropical regions of the world. 

Pitaya usually refers to the fruit of the genus Stenocereus, while pitahaya or dragon fruit refers to fruit of the genus Selenicereus (formerly Hylocereus), both in the family Cactaceae. The common name in English – dragon fruit – derives from the leather-like skin and scaly spikes on the fruit exterior. Depending on the variety, pitaya fruits may have sweet- or sour-tasting flesh that can be red, white, or yellow. 

Selenicereus has adapted to live in dry tropical climates with a moderate amount of rain. In numerous regions, it has escaped cultivation to become a weed and is classified as an invasive weed in some countries.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Grows year-round in Sri Lanka.

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Direct seeding, stem cuttings |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Cuttings should be taken from selected mother plants which are bearing fruits. Cuttings should be 15-20 centimeters in length and stored in a dry place for 1-2 days before planting. Cuttings should be planted in pots which are filled with a well-drained potting mix. For the potting mix, a mixture of dried cow dung, topsoil, and sand in a 1:1:2 ratio is optimal. To ensure cuttings take root, the pots should be kept in normal wet conditions and under shading. After the growth of shoots, stem cuttings are trained for the environment and then used for planting on posts. |
| Soil | Well-drained soil is necessary for dragon fruit cultivation. The plant is highly responsive to organic matter, and 10-30% sand level is favorable. The plant grows well in sandy soil. |
| Water | Adequate irrigation must be provided, especially in dry conditions. In Sri Lanka's dry zone, drip irrigation is recommended for efficient water use. |
| Light | Full or partial sunlight. |

### Growing conditions:
As the plant creeps upwards along the supportive structure, 5-6 ft high concrete or wooden posts should be placed closer to the plant. Upward growth of the plant should be facilitated by tightening the growing stem to the post. Aerial roots develop on the stem, binding the stem tightly to the post. The lateral shoots that develop on an upward growing stem should be limited and 2-3 main stems should be allowed to grow. Lateral shoots should be removed time to time.

| **Temperatures** | 20-30 degrees celsius |
|----|----|
| Soil | Well-drained soil is necessary for dragon fruit cultivation. The plant is highly responsive to organic matter and 10-30% sand level is favourable. The plant is well-grown in sandy soil. |
| Water | Irrigation is required during the dry season. In the dry zone, an irrigation system should be established. |
| Pruning | Prune plants annually after fruiting to maintain shape and encourage new growth. |
| Weed control | Keep the area around the plant free of weeds to prevent competition for nutrients and water.|

## Harvesting:
Fruits mature 40-50 days after the appearance of flower buds or 30-35 days after blooming of flowers. The fruiting period will continue up to November and during this period harvesting can be done 5-6 times.

## Curing:
Dragon fruit does not require a curing stage.

## Storage
The fruit can be stored for about 40 days at 5°C and 90% relative humidity (RH). Storing at high temperatures rapidly reduces fruit quality.

Certainly. I'll convert the disease and pest information from the reference file into the format you've specified:

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:**
- Fruit fly
- Stem rot
- Brown patches

**Symptoms:**
- **Fruit fly:** Fruits can be damaged by the attack of fruit fly.
  
- **Stem rot:** At the first stage brownish, oval shaped, moderately sunken lesions/patches appear on thorny ribs of the stem. Gradually those lesions combine together, turn yellow, and then rot spreads along the edges.
  
- **Brown patches:** Small, yellowish, moderately sunken spots appear on the stem. Gradually it becomes larger spots and turns to red and then brown. Subsequently, the stem starts to rot and finally damaged areas become thicker walled lesions.

**Control method:**
- **Fruit fly:** Cover fruits, bury infected fruits about 2ft deep or remove infected fruits by covering with black polythene bags, use protein traps, use pheromone traps (Methyl Euginol).
  
- **Stem rot:** Use fungicides recommended for controlling Anthracnose in other cultivations (Manab, Mancozab, Carbendazim).
  
- **Brown patches:** Remove and destroy infected parts. Do not use diseased plants for propagation.

### Disease Control
**Disease type:**
- Anthracnose
- Stem canker

**Symptoms:**
- **Anthracnose:** Brownish, oval-shaped, moderately sunken lesions/patches appear on thorny ribs of the stem. Lesions combine, turn yellow, and rot spreads along the edges.
  
- **Stem canker:** Small (1mm), yellowish, moderately sunken spots appear on the stem, growing to 4mm. Spots turn red then brown. Stem starts to rot, damaged areas become thicker-walled lesions. Can also damage fruits.

**Management:**
- **Anthracnose:** Use fungicides recommended for controlling Anthracnose in other cultivations (Manab, Mancozab, Carbendazim).
  
- **Stem canker:** Remove and destroy infected parts. Do not use diseased plants for propagation.

**For all diseases:**
- Plant with proper spacing
- Remove unnecessary shoots
- Avoid over-irrigation
- Maintain proper drainage in the rainy season

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Dragon fruit grows well in the dry zone with adequate irrigation.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Pest control may be more challenging due to higher temperatures.
- Implement drip irrigation systems for water conservation.
- Use shade nets during extreme heat periods.

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Dragon fruit can be grown successfully in the midcountry with moderate care.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Prune plants annually to maintain shape and encourage new growth.
- Monitor for fungal diseases due to moderate humidity.
- Adjust fertilization based on soil tests specific to the region.

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Dragon fruit may struggle in the upcountry due to cooler temperatures.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide additional warmth during flowering season.
- Use plastic tunnels or greenhouses to extend the growing season.
- Choose varieties more tolerant to cooler temperatures.
