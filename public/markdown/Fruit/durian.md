## Description:
The durian is the edible fruit of several tree species belonging to the genus Durio. <update>In Sri Lanka, durian cultivation is relatively new but gaining popularity, especially in the wet and intermediate zones. The fruit is known for its distinctive odor and unique taste, which has made it a delicacy among Sri Lankan fruit enthusiasts.</update>

Named in some regions as the "king of fruits", the durian is distinctive for its large size, strong odour, and thorn-covered rind. The fruit can grow as large as 30 centimetres long and 15 cm in diameter, and it typically weighs 1 to 3 kilograms. Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the colour of its husk green to brown, and its flesh pale yellow to red, depending on the species.

Varieties in Sri Lanka include Kasun, Ambatenna, Horana Gold, Horana Jumbo, and Gannoruwa Sweet.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>October to December (during the North-East monsoon)</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Direct seeding or grafting                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Planting method | Durian can be planted through direct seeding and grafting. Direct seeding is not recommended for commercial use due to the length of time it takes for trees to grow and variations in fruit quality. |
| Soil            | Rich, deep, well-drained sandy clay or clay loam (deep alluvial or loamy soil), high in organic matter, pH range of 6 - 7                                                                             |
| Water           | <update>Regular watering is essential, especially during dry periods. Irrigation may be necessary in areas with less than 2000mm annual rainfall.</update>                                            |
| Light           | <update>Full sun to partial shade, with protection from strong winds</update>                                                                                                                         |

### Growing conditions:
 Following planting, young durian trees should be provided with temporary shade and complete wind protection for the first year, as in a shadecloth nursery structure or equivalent. The structure of the young trees and their leaves is such that strong winds can twist the leaves right off, a setback from which they are unlikely to ever fully recover.

Proper pruning of the durian tree is important to obtain a tree form that encourages early flowering and good yields.

| Temperatures | <update>24-30 degrees Celsius</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | <update>Well-drained, fertile soil rich in organic matter. Common in the red-yellow podzolic soils of Sri Lanka's wet zone.</update> |
| Water | <update>Regular watering is essential, especially during dry periods. Irrigation may be necessary in areas with less than 2000mm annual rainfall.</update> |
| Pruning | Proper pruning of the durian tree is important to obtain a tree form that encourages early flowering and good yields. |
| Weed control | Regular weeding around the base of the tree |

## Harvesting:
Grafted trees start yielding fruits in 4-6 years. 10-40 fruits per tree in the first year of fruiting and up to 200 fruit per year after the 10th year of fruiting. <update>In Sri Lanka, the main harvesting season is from June to August.</update>

## Curing:
<update>The fruit is ripe when it falls from the tree or can be easily detached with a gentle pull.</update>

## Storage
<update>Durian fruits can be stored at room temperature for about two days. For longer storage, they can be refrigerated at 10°C (50°F) for up to one week.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Except for usually light damage by local fruit borers, beetles, and leaf cutters in some areas, the tree and fruit tend to be relatively free of insect pests. Phytophthora palmivora is a dreaded fungus disease of durian trees in Southeast Asia. 

**Symptoms:** Holes in leaves or fruits, wilting leaves, fruit drop

**Control method:** Steps can be taken to eliminate a moist microclimate at the base of the tree which might support the growth of P. palmivora, and removing any branches starting to grow below about 1 metre in height. Growth of P. palmivora in Southeast Asia is also controlled by using cultivars known to be resistant.

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** <update>Phytophthora palmivora, stem canker, and root rot</update>

**Symptoms:** Brown spots on leaves, fruit rot, wilting, and dieback

**Management:** <update>Proper drainage, avoiding waterlogging, regular pruning to improve air circulation, and application of copper-based fungicides when necessary. Use of disease-resistant varieties developed by Sri Lankan research institutions.</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: **5/10**)
**Explanation:** <update>The wet zone provides ideal conditions for durian cultivation with high rainfall and suitable temperatures.</update>
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Manage excess moisture to prevent fungal diseases.</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: **8/10**)
**Explanation:** <update>The dry zone's low rainfall and high temperatures pose significant challenges for durian cultivation.</update>
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Implement efficient irrigation systems and provide shade during extreme heat.</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: **6/10**)
**Explanation:** <update>The mid country offers moderate conditions but may require additional care during dry spells.</update>
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Supplement rainfall with irrigation during dry periods and protect from occasional frost in higher elevations.</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: **7/10**)
**Explanation:** <update>The cooler temperatures and potential frost in the up country can be challenging for durian trees.</update>
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Choose cold-tolerant varieties and provide protection from frost and strong winds. Consider greenhouse cultivation in very high altitudes.</update>
