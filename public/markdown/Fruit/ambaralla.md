## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Dry season/ spring to summer

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Mostly grown from seed but can be propagated from cuttings as well |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Can be grown in a container or the ground. To plant in the ground, dig a hole three times as wide and just as deep as the root ball. Plant firmly in the ground and cover the top layer of soil with 2-3 inches of mulch. |
| Soil | Grows in any type of soil as long as they are well draining. Does not need high nutrition, though it grows well when fed properly. They grow well in acidic to slightly alkaline soils with a pH of 5.5-7.5.Â  |
| Water | Young plants should be watered more often than the older plants |
| Light | Requires full to partial sunshine (4-6 hours of sunlight each day) |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Grows best in humid tropical and subtropical climates |
|----|----|
| Soil | Cover the top layer of soil with mulch |
| Water | One to two times per week for the first few months. Then once a week during dry periods |
| Pruning | Prune in late winter or early spring to remove dead, damaged, or diseased branches.
| Weed control | Mulching helps control weeds and retains soil moisture.

## Harvesting:
Can be picked when green or golden yellow

## Curing:
Fruits can be eaten fresh off the tree. For storage, cure green fruits at room temperature for a week to allow them to ripen further.

## Storage
Store ripe fruits in the refrigerator for up to several days.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Caribbean fruit fly, Scale insects
**Symptoms:** Holes in fruits, sticky honeydew on leaves
**Control method:** Bag the fruit on the tree for protection, oil sprays

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** Fusarium wilt, anthracnose
**Symptoms:** Wilted leaves and branches, dark spots on fruits
**Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, remove infected plant material, use fungicides as a last resort.

## Difficulty Rating

### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Amberella can be challenging in the wet zone due to high rainfall and humidity, which can increase the risk of fungal diseases. Regular pruning and fungicide applications may be necessary to manage diseases.

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Amberella is more suited to the dry zone, where rainfall is lower and humidity is not as high. Ensure consistent watering during dry periods.

### Mid country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Amberella can be grown in the mid countries, but may require some care to manage diseases and ensure adequate watering. Regular pruning and monitoring for pests and diseases is necessary.

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Amberella may struggle in the upcountry due to cooler temperatures and shorter days, which can affect fruit production. Provide protection from strong winds and ensure adequate sunlight.
