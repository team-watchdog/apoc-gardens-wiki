# Namu-Namu

## General Information
**Generic name:** Namu-Namu
**Sri Lankan name:** Namnam (Sinhala)
**Scientific name:** Cynometra cauliflora
**Plant family:** <update>Fabaceae</update>
**Edible parts:** Fruit
**Other uses:** Grown as an ornamental plant
**Companion plants:**
- <update>Curry leaves (Murraya koenigii), which can help repel pests and attract beneficial insects.</update>
**Non-companion plants**
- <update>Chili peppers (Capsicum spp.), as they may compete for nutrients and water.</update>

## Description:
Cynometra cauliflora is a small, cauliflorous tree with a thick, heavily branched stem, and rather small flowers, about 1.2 cm (0.5 in) across, that appear on the stem in clusters. <update>In Sri Lanka, it is primarily known as Namnam and is found in home gardens and some commercial plantations, particularly in the wet and intermediate zones.</update>

The fruits are kidney-shaped, 5–10 cm (2–4 in) long and 5 cm (2 in). The pod does not split open readily, but a line is visible along the fruit and divides it into two. The texture of the skin is coriaceous and uneven, colored a pale greenish/yellow to brown. The pod is edible, with aromatic and juicy yellow pulp, and relatively large seeds.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>October to November (during the north-east monsoon)</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Direct seeding or through budding |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Well-draining soil is ideal. |
| Soil | <update>Avoid waterlogging, especially during monsoon seasons. Ensure proper drainage.</update> |
| Water | <update>Partial sunlight. 3-6 hours a day. Can also grow in full sunlight but will require adequate water, especially during dry spells.</update> |

### Growing conditions:

| Temperatures | <update>Adaptable plant that can grow in most Sri Lankan climates, but may require protection from extreme heat in dry zones.</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | Well draining soil is ideal |
| Water | <update>Regular watering during dry periods, especially in dry and intermediate zones.</update> |
| Pruning | Prune in late winter to early spring to encourage bushier growth.
| Weed control | Mulch around the base of the plant to suppress weeds and retain moisture.

## Harvesting:
6 years for plants to mature and bear fruit. Fruits are ready to harvest when they turn yellow-brown.

## Curing:
The fruits can be eaten fresh or dried for later use.

## Storage
<update>Store fresh fruits in a cool, dry place for up to a week. For longer storage, dry the pods and keep them in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for up to 6 months.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** <update>Mealybugs</update>

**Symptoms:** <update>White, cottony masses on stems and leaves, stunted growth.</update>

**Control method:** <update>Use neem oil or introduce natural predators like ladybugs. Prune affected parts if infestation is severe.</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** <update>Root rot</update>

**Symptoms:** <update>Yellowing leaves, wilting, stunted growth, and eventual plant death.</update>

**Management:** <update>Ensure well-draining soil, avoid overwatering, and improve soil aeration. Remove affected plants to prevent spread.</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Namu-Namu thrives in the wet zone due to high rainfall and humidity. However, care must be taken to prevent fungal diseases.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Implement proper drainage systems to prevent waterlogging during heavy monsoon rains.</update>
### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Namu-Namu can tolerate dry conditions but may require additional irrigation during prolonged dry spells.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Use mulching to retain soil moisture and reduce water evaporation.</update>
### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** <update>The mid-country climate is generally suitable for Namu-Namu, offering a balance of rainfall and temperature.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Protect plants from strong winds, especially during the south-west monsoon season.</update>
### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Namu-Namu may struggle with colder temperatures in higher elevations but can be grown with proper care.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Plant in sheltered locations to protect from cold winds and frost.</update>
- <update>Consider using polytunnels or greenhouses for cultivation in very high elevations.</update>
