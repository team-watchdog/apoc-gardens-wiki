## Description:
Syzygium samarangense is a tropical tree growing to 12 m (39 ft) tall, with evergreen leaves 10–25 cm (4–10 in) long and 5–10 cm (2–4 in) broad. The leaves are elliptical, but rounded at the base; they are aromatic when crushed. The trunk is relatively short, with a wide – yet open – crown starting low on the tree. The bark is pinkish-gray in color, and flakes readily.

The flowers are white to yellowish-white, 2.5 cm (1 in) diameter, with four petals and numerous stamens. They form in panicles of between three and 30 near branch tips. The resulting fruit is a bell-shaped, edible berry, with colors ranging from white, pale green, or green to red, purple, or crimson, to deep purple or even black.

## Planting requirements
<update>**Planting season:** Best planted at the onset of the rainy season (October to November) in Sri Lanka</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Direct seeding, budding, grafting |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Direct seeding, budding, grafting |
| Soil | Well-draining soil is required. <update>Loamy soils common in Sri Lanka's wet and intermediate zones are ideal.</update> |
| Water | Must be watered regularly to maintain soil moisture especially in dry conditions. |
| Light | Full or partial sunlight |
| Fertiliser / Mulch | Apply a balanced fertilizer once a year after fruiting season. <update>Use of organic compost is recommended.</update> |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | <update>Thrives in Sri Lanka's tropical climate with temperatures between 22°C to 32°C.</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | Well-draining soil is required. <update>pH range of 5.5 to 6.5 is ideal, which is common in many parts of Sri Lanka.</update> |
| Water | Must be watered regularly to maintain soil moisture especially in dry conditions. |
| Pruning | Prune annually after fruiting season to encourage new growth. |
| Weed control | Keep the area around the tree weed-free to prevent competition for nutrients and water. |

## Harvesting:
Trees planted through direct seeding will bear fruit in about 3 years. Budded or grafted trees may provide a harvest in one to one and a half years.

**Curing:**
Fruits are ready to pick when they turn their final color (red, purple, etc.) and yield slightly to gentle pressure.

**Storage:**
Store fruits in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Avoid storing with ethylene-producing fruits like apples or bananas.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** <update>In Sri Lanka, common pests include fruit flies, mealy bugs, and scale insects.</update>
**Symptoms:** Fruit flies cause small holes in the fruit, while mealy bugs and scale insects cause yellowing and wilting leaves.
**Control method:** <update>Use of neem oil, sticky traps, and promoting natural predators like ladybugs are effective organic control methods.</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** <update>In Sri Lanka's humid climate, fungal diseases like anthracnose and root rot are common.</update>
**Symptoms:** Wilting leaves, dark spots on fruits, and rotting roots.
**Management:** <update>Improve air circulation, avoid overwatering, and apply copper-based fungicides if necessary.</update>

## Difficulty Rating

### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Jambu trees thrive in the wet zone due to high rainfall and suitable temperatures.</update>
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Monitor for fungal diseases due to high humidity.

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Jambu trees can grow in the dry zone but require more watering and protection from strong winds.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Implement drip irrigation and use mulching to conserve soil moisture.</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Jambu trees grow well in the mid-country with moderate temperatures.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Protect from occasional frost in higher elevations.</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 8/10)
**Explanation:** Jambu trees can grow in the up-country but may require protection from frost and strong winds.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Use of wind breaks and frost protection measures are essential.</update>
