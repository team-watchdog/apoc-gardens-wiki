## General Information
**Generic name:** Capsicum
**Sri Lankan name:** Maalu Miris (Sinhala)
**Scientific name:** _Capsicum annuum_
**Plant family:** _Solanaceae_
**Edible parts:** Fruit
**Nutrition value:** Banana peppers are excellent sources of Vitamin C, Vitamin A, Vitamin B6, Vitamin K, Potassium, Calcium and Folate. 

## Companion plants:
- Pepper plants make good neighbours for asparagus, basil, carrots, cucumbers, eggplant, endive, oregano, parsley, rosemary, squash, Swiss chard, and tomatoes

**Non-companion plants:**
- Avoid planting next to beans, brassicas, and fennel

## Description:
The banana pepper is a medium-sized member of the chili pepper family that has a mild, tangy taste. While typically bright yellow, it is possible for them to change to green, red, or orange as they ripen. It is often pickled, stuffed or used as a raw ingredient in foods. It is a cultivar of the species Capsicum annuum.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** 
- Yala season – April and May
- Maha season – November and December

It can be cultivated throughout the year under supplementary irrigation and also under rain shelters or greenhouses.

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Direct seeding or transplanting                                                           |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Direct seeding or transplanting. Seeds germinate in 8-10 days. Seedlings are ready to plant in 21 days |
| Soil | Grows well in well drained, deep and fertile loam soils. Sandy soils also good when required amount of organic matter added. pH value between 5.5 -6.8 is preferred. Plough the field up to 15-20 cm depth. Raised beds have to be prepared for better drainage.Soil should be well-drained and fertile with a pH between 5.5 and 7.0. |
| Water | Irrigation to be practiced in 4-5 day intervals at early stages and 1 week interval at latter stages of the crop. This depends on the rainfall. Irrigation is required before and after fertilizer application, and during flowering and fruit development stages. Water regularly, especially during fruiting. |
| Light | Requires plenty of sunlight like other peppers |

### Growing conditions:

| Temperatures | Above 15 degrees and below 35 degrees celsius. |

## Harvesting:
First harvesting can be done 75 days after nursery sowing and at 5-7 day intervals. Thereafter in 7-10 picks during the crop growth. Practice harvesting in dry weather conditions.

## Curing:
Banana Pepper does not require a curing stage

## Storage
Banan peppers should be kept in a cool environment. Properly stored in the fridge, they last about one week.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** 
- leaf beetles
- Caterpillars
- White flies

**Symptoms:** 
- **White flies:** Acts as vectors carrying 'leaf curl virus disease'

**Control method:** A wind barrier such as maize is recommended as a preventative action. Growing aromatic companion herbs can also serve as pest repellents.

Nurseries should be established in well-drained areas and areas where Solanaceae crops such as tomatoes, brinjals, and chillies are not grown in previous seasons. Avoid sowing too many seeds in the nursery (3m x 1m size bed-40g seeds are recommended). The diseased parts/plants should be removed and destroyed.

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** 
- Damping off (_Fusarium spp._, _Pythium spp._, _Rhizoctonia spp._, _Sclerotium spp._)
- Anthracnose (_Colletotrichum spp_)
- Bacterial wilt (_Ralstonia solanacearum_)
- Leaf curl virus disease
- Leaf spot disease (_Cercospora capsici._)
- Powdery mildew
- Choanephora blight

**Symptoms:** 
- **Damping off:** Damping-off occurs in two stages: pre-emergence, where seedlings rot and die before emerging from the soil, and post-emergence, where seedlings collapse after emerging, showing signs of moisture, soft rot at the base or roots, withered leaves, and scattered dead plants when the infection is severe.
- **Anthracnose:** Symptoms of the disease include discoloration of leaves, stems, and flower stalks, with falling flowers and young pods; small, round, sunken lesions on pod surfaces that spread and form brown circular spots on ripe pods, which develop blackish spores in concentric rings, leading to pod rot and, when severe, a dieback that starts at the tip and spreads downwards, causing the entire plant to wither and die.
- **Bacterial wilt:** The disease appears as single or multiple withered plants, with immature leaves wilting in heat and leading to death a few days after leaf shredding; diagnosis involves suspending a cut diseased stem in water to observe bacterial ooze.
- **Leaf curl virus disease:** Infected plants exhibit yellowing leaves with visible veins, dwarfism from shortened internodes and excessive shoots, upward curling of reduced-size leaves, and small pods.
- **Leaf spot disease:** 
**Management:** NA

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: **Medium**/10)
**Explanation:** Banana peppers require consistent moisture but are prone to fungal diseases in overly wet conditions.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Fungal diseases can be a challenge. Ensure good air circulation and avoid overwatering.</update>
### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: **Easy**/10)
**Explanation:** The dry zone's hot, sunny climate is well-suited to banana peppers.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Drought stress can be an issue. Ensure consistent watering.</update>
### Mid country (Difficulty: **Medium**/10)
**Explanation:** The mid country's varied climate requires careful attention to temperature and moisture levels.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Temperature fluctuations can affect fruit set. Provide shade during peak heat hours if necessary.</update>
### Up country (Difficulty: **Hard**/10)
**Explanation:** The upcountry's cooler temperatures and higher rainfall make growing banana peppers more challenging.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Cooler temperatures can slow growth. Provide additional warmth with row covers or black plastic mulch.</update>
