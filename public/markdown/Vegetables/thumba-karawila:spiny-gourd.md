## Description:
Thumba Karawila is a species of flowering plant in the Cucurbitaceae/gourd family. It is widely consumed as a vegetable in Sri Lanka. Different types of plants provide differently shaped fruit: oval, cylindrical and spherical. Below are the plant varieties listed by the Department of Agriculture, Sri Lanka.

Female plant varieties – Thumbika / Golika / Wisal / Kesara / Chandu
Male plant Varieties – Parakum, wishma
Hybrid: Female -Chandu, male – Wishma

<update>Plant grows well in lowland dry zone areas of Sri Lanka, particularly in the North Central, Eastern, and Southern provinces. It is also cultivated in home gardens throughout the country.</update>

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** It is advisable to start sowing in the Maha season – September – October and in the Yala season – March – April. If additional water facilities are available, it is advisable to plant in mid-December after the end of the heavy rains of the Maha season. Planting can be done at any time of the year if water is available.

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Stem cuttings with 2-4 inter-nodes are suitable for planting. When propagated by tubers, obtain tubers with a few eyes after the dormancy period of about 4 months from the previous season. Cut those tubers into about 40g pieces and plant in a sand nursery. If the seeds are sown, store the seeds obtained from the previous season under normal conditions for about 9 months and plant 4 seeds in one place and remove the other seedlings at a ratio of 6:1 – 10: 1 |

| Soil | <update>Grows well in non-loamy reddish-brown soils common in Sri Lanka's dry zone. It can also thrive in well-drained soils rich in organic matter found in other parts of the country.</update> |
| Water | <update>Provide adequate water to ensure plants do not wilt. In dry zone areas, regular irrigation is crucial, especially during prolonged dry spells.</update> |
| Light | Plentiful sunshine |

### Growing conditions:

| Temperatures | 27 - 32°C, which is typical in many parts of Sri Lanka, especially in the lowland areas                                                                                                           |

## Harvesting:
When plants are initiated with seeds flowering begins at about 3 months after seeding. Flowers obtained 2 months after crop establishment using plant-lets obtained from stem cuttings. A fruit yield of 6– 8 kg per year can be obtained from one female vine.

## Curing:
<update>Cure fruits by allowing them to ripen on the vine until they turn yellow. Then, store in a cool, dry place for up to two weeks. In Sri Lanka's humid climate, ensure good air circulation to prevent mold growth.</update>

## Storage
<update>Store fruits in a refrigerator at temperatures between 10-15°C (50-59°F) for up to four weeks. In areas without refrigeration, store in a cool, dry place and consume within a week.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Insects including fruit flies, beetles, caterpillars and leaf miners may also threaten the crop.

**Symptoms:** Insects cause holes in leaves and fruits.

**Control method:**  Insect traps can be used for fruit flies.
- Collect infested and fallen fruits and bum in deep pits.
- Change the sowing dates as the fly population is low in hot dry conditions and at its peak during rainy season.
- Expose the pupae by ploughing and turning over soil after harvest.
- Use ribbed gourd as trap crop and apply carbaryl 0.15% or malathion 0.1% on congregating adult flies on the undersurface of leaves.
- Use attractants like citronella oil, eucalyptus oil, vinegar (acetic acid), and lactic acid to trap flies.
- Use poison baiting in severe infestation
- Mix methyl eugenol + malathion 50 EC at 1:1 ratio and keep 10 ml of the bait in polythene bags (25 per hectare).

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** Root rot and downy mildew can occur at any growth stage. Diseases are caused by fungi or bacteria.

**Symptoms:** Root rot - wilting plants, yellowing leaves, and poor fruit set. Downy mildew - yellow spots on upper surface of leaves, white patches on lower surface, and distorted leaves.

**Management:**
It is important to maintain good drainage in the field and remove diseased vines. Department of Agriculture recommends applying fungicide to deal with downy mildew (thiophanate methyl 85% +, thiram 35% or Carbendazim). 

## Difficulty Rating
