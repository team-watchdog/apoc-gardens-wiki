## Description:
A large trailing plant with yellow, bell-shaped flowers, pumpkin is a plant that is frost tender. Most varieties will take up a lot of room. Better to grow them at the edge of a garden patch as they need lots of space to spread. <update>In Sri Lanka, pumpkins are commonly grown in home gardens and are an important crop in rural areas.</update>

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>Year-round in most parts of Sri Lanka, with peak planting during the Maha season (October to January)</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Seeds |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Prepare land to a depth of about 20-30 cm and harrow for fine tilth. Make planting holes 30 x 30 x 30 cm and then add organic matter per planting hole, mix with soil and heap to about 10 cm above ground level. <update>In Sri Lanka, it's common to plant pumpkins on mounds or in raised beds to improve drainage during heavy rains.</update> |
| Soil | Soil should be rich in humus with a pH range of 5.5 – 7.5. Ideally a moist, loamy soil. Pumpkins are heavy feeders and hence add aged manure or compost mixed with water to the side of the plant. <update>In Sri Lanka, adding coconut husk or straw as mulch is a common practice to retain soil moisture.</update> |
| Water | It is important to keep moisture in the soil. Pumpkins need 1 inch of water per week. Water deeply, in the morning and on very hot afternoons, especially during fruit set. Avoid watering foliage and fruit unless it's a sunny day. Dampness invites rot and disease. Planting in raised beds promote drainage ensuring that the root has ideal moisture levels. <update>In dry zones of Sri Lanka, more frequent watering may be necessary.</update> |
| Light | Full sunlight (at least six hours of light per day) to produce and mature their fruits). |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Needs a temperature between 65° and 95°F (18° to 35°C) <update>which is well-suited to Sri Lanka's tropical climate</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | Add mulch around your pumpkins to retain moisture, suppress weeds, and discourage pests. <update>In Sri Lanka, locally available materials like rice straw or coconut leaves are commonly used as mulch.</update> |
| Water | Irrigate daily until germination is complete and every 7 days thereafter. Give your plants at least 1 to 2 inches of water per week, especially when they're blooming and setting fruit. Drip irrigation or ground level soaking rather than from overhead. <update>In dry zones of Sri Lanka, more frequent irrigation may be necessary, especially during dry spells.</update> |
| Pruning | <update>In Sri Lanka, pruning is often done to control vine growth and improve air circulation, which helps prevent fungal diseases in humid conditions.</update> |

## Harvesting:
Can be harvested within 15-20 weeks. Harvest when the vines die off and the pumpkins' stalks are dry. harvest them when they are fully mature—and not before. <update>In Sri Lanka, pumpkins are often harvested when the skin is hard and cannot be punctured with a fingernail.</update>

## Curing:
<update>After harvest, pumpkins are typically cured in a warm, dry place for about a week to improve storage life and flavor.</update>

## Storage
<update>In Sri Lanka, pumpkins are often stored in cool, dry places like attics or under beds. They can last for several months if properly cured and stored.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Beetles, Snails and Slugs, Squash bugs, Vine borers, Aphids

**Symptoms:** <update>Holes in leaves, wilting plants, distorted fruits, and presence of pests on plant surfaces</update>

**Control method:** Spray mild insecticide, introduction of natural predators like ladybugs, and the installation of reflective mulch. <update>In Sri Lanka, traditional methods like neem oil sprays and ash applications are also commonly used for pest control.</update>

### Disease Control
<update>Common diseases in Sri Lanka include powdery mildew and downy mildew. Control methods include proper spacing for air circulation, avoiding overhead watering, and applying fungicides when necessary.</update>
