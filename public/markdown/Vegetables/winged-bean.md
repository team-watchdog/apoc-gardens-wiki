## Description:
Winged bean is a short day plant that required less than 12 hours of day length. There are two main types of winged bean; short podded ones which are used for tubers <update>and have poor seeds</update> and long podded ones which have good seeds but poor tubers.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Rainy Season

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Seeds that are planted during rainy season germinate and grow slowly for the first 3 or 5 weeks. For tubers, vines are pruned off at about 1 m high <update>or left unstaked</update> and some flowers are removed. |
|----|----|
| Planting method | <update>Plant seeds in rows that are 60 cm apart with a spacing of 25 cm between plants.</update>
| Soil | Grow on a wide variety of soils. Soil should not retain too much water <update>and should have a pH between 5.5 and 7</update>. |
| Water | Intolerant of water logging (saturation of water in soil) |
| Light | Partial sunlight as shading improves pod length and seed number <update>but excessive shade can reduce yield</update>. |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | For maximum seed production winged beans requires temperatures between 23째C and 27째C <update>and for tubers the temperatures should be between 18째C and 25째C</update>. |
|----|----|
| Soil | Winged beans have been grown on soils with pH from 3.6 to 8.0.They are sensitive to the soils which are very acidic <update>and prefer well-drained soil with a high organic matter content</update>. |
| Water | Water them in the morning before the heat of the day absorb the moisture <update>As they grow in warm and wet tropics, they need moisture with regular watering, about 1 inch per week</update>. |
| Pruning | <update>Prune plants to encourage bushier growth and more pods.</update>
| Weed control | <update>Keep the area around winged bean plants weed-free to prevent competition for nutrients and water.</update>

## Harvesting:
Approximately 10 weeks after sowing. Pods develop 10 to 13 weeks after planting <update>and tubers occur 4-5 months after planting</update>.

## Curing:
<update>After harvesting, cure pods at room temperature for a week before storing.</update>

## Storage
<update>Store pods in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. Tubers can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Aphids are the most common issues for winged beans and bean vines.
**Symptoms:** <update>Curling leaves, yellowing leaves, and stunted growth</update>
**Control method:** if this goes unchecked, it may increase the threat of aphid-borne viruses, such as bean mosaic virus. Some beneficial insects such as ladybugs and lacewings will happily consume aphids <update>but if aphids appear at a rapid rate, use a blast of water to knock them off the plant or apply insecticidal soap</update>.

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** <update>Anthracnose, Angular leaf spot, and Rust</update>
**Symptoms:** <update>Brown spots on leaves that enlarge and turn black, yellow spots with dark edges on leaves, and orange-brown pustules on leaves</update>
**Management:** <update>Avoid overhead watering, remove infected plant material, and apply fungicides if necessary</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Winged beans are relatively easy to grow but require consistent moisture.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Watch for aphids and treat accordingly. Ensure soil is well-drained to prevent waterlogging.</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Winged beans can be grown in the dry zone but require more careful watering.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Provide consistent moisture, especially during flowering and pod development. Protect plants from strong winds.</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Winged beans grow well in the mid country but may require some protection from strong winds.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Ensure soil is well-drained to prevent waterlogging. Provide some shade during hot periods.</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Winged beans can be grown in the up country but may require additional care due to cooler temperatures.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Provide protection from frost. Ensure soil is well-drained to prevent waterlogging.</update>
