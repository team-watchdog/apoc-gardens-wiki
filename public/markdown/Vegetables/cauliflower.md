## Description:
The plant consists of a thick stem surrounded by leaves on top of which the curd grows. They are annual plants that reach about 0.5 metres in height. Cauliflower plants develop a central main flower-head (curd), which can weigh from 0.5 kg to over 2.5 kg. Commercially, white cauliflower is the most common, though orange, purple, green, and brown cultivars also exist. The plants produce cross-shaped yellow flowers and bear seeds in dry capsules known as siliques.

## Planting requirements
- Ideally suited for cool-weathers and requires consistent temperatures of about 16 °C (60 °F) to produce heads. However, can be grown in all agro-climatic zones with certain varieties which can be grown in upland, lowland and intermediate zones in Sri Lanka.

**Planting season:** <update>In Sri Lanka:
- Middle country wet zone – January, February and November, December
- Upland wet zone – January, February, March and October, November, December
- Upland dry zone – January, February and November, December</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Propagation from root-shoot cuttings recommended to be the most efficient method                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Planting method | **Plant seed shallowly**, one fourth to one-half inch deep, dropping a seed every 40 cm. There should be a distance of 40-50 cms between rows. Seed requirement: 300 grams per hectare. When planting in a field, it is recommended to turn the soil 30-40 cms deep, then level the soil in preparation. Seedlings of 3-4 week maturity should then be replanted in raised beds or rows. |
| Soil            | Requires moist nitrogen-rich soil and will produce only small heads if stressed with drought. Well-drained yet moisture-retentive, fertile soil with pH of 6 to 6.8 ideal. Soil with clay loam and slit recommended for high yield.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Water           | Water regularly with 2 inches of water per square foot each week; even with normal rainfall, this usually requires supplemental watering Once the seedlings have taken root, water twice a day for two weeks. Following which water in consideration of rainfall.                                                                                                                        |
| Light           | Cauliflower should be grown in a spot that gets full sun (6 to 8 hours of sunlight per day). Lack of sunlight may produce thin, leggy plants and subpar heads                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### Growing conditions:

| Temperatures | Shade should be provided to prevent wilting of young plants. Banana leaves can be used for coverage. When the inflorescences begin to form, the flower should be covered by the cauliflower leaves so as to block direct sunlight. Temperature of 50 to 70 faranite required. Exposure to high temperatures produce poor quality curds.                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Soil**     | Sandy loamy soil preferred for early corps while loam and clay loam preferred for late crops.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Water        | Once the seedlings have taken root, water twice a day for two weeks. Following which water in consideration of rainfall. If the plants do not receive consistent rainfall or irrigation, they will have poor texture and may develop strong “off” flavour.  If the planting does not receive one inch of rain each week, soak the soil thoroughly at least once a week. |
| Pruning      | N/A                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Harvesting:
Harvest can be obtained in 60-75 days from planting. Variations in this time-line can be experienced on the basis of climatic zones/plant variety. 6-9 tons can be expected per Hectare. Harvest cauliflower when heads reach usable size, before the flower buds open. Cut the head above ground level and remove the leaves wrapped around the head. If you leave curds on the plant for too long, they will become loose.

## Curing:
<update>After harvesting, cure the cauliflower by storing it at 32-35°F (0-1.7°C) with high humidity for about two weeks to enhance its keeping quality.</update>

## Storage
<update>Store cured cauliflower at 32-36°F (0-2°C) and high humidity for up to 2-3 months.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** SL: Kalukiyath Maggot, Clubroot (caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae), Turfgrass Diseases

**Symptoms:** [EMPTY]

**Control method:**
- **Clubroot**: Check the soil and if necessary use ash to adjust the pH. Uproot and burn infected plants.
- **Turfgrass Diseases:** Damping-Off Diseases (Causal Fungi: Pythium, Rhizoctonia, and Fusarium spp.): Minimize soil borne pathogens by burning the soil before planting,
- Aphids: Rinse them off with a steady and firm stream of water from the hose. If this proves ineffective, use a product such as neem oil, a natural insecticide and fungicide.
- Cabbage Loopers: A treatment with organic Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt, is recommended. Optional: Dousing plants with white flour (not self-rising) early in the morning. Dew plus flour equals petrified bugs that may be rinsed off the following day.
- Cabbage Moths: Difficult insect to deal with. Treat with neem oil or Bt/'trap cropping' method: planting a barrier of another plant the pest likes around the cauliflower, collard greens are recommended.
- Cabbage Root Maggots: If tiny flies are seen around crops, apply diatomaceous earth to the soil over the roots to discourage egg laying. If plants are showing signs of distress, dig down, examine the roots, and discard infested plants. Alternatively, an application of nematodes, Steinernema feltiae, which are microscopic worms that attack soil borne pests.

### Disease Control
