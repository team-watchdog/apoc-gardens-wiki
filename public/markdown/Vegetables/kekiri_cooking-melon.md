| Planting method | 500g of seeds is sufficient for one hectare of land. One gram of seeds contains 90 – 100 seeds. When planting inter row spacing and the intra row spacing of 1.0m is recommended. The planting holes are prepared as 30cm3 (length, width and depth) and the holes are filled with a large amount of decomposed organic matter and mixed with the topsoil. It is filled up to a 10 cm height. Plant about 3-4 seeds in prepared pits. At 2 weeks of emerging, remove weak seedlings allowing two healthy seedlings to grow |
| Soil            | Plough the soil to a depth of 20-30 cm and crush the larger particles to a slightly rougher texture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Melon fly, Aulacophora beetle, Epilachna beetle, aphid, white fly
**Symptoms:** 
**Control method:** Maintain field sanitation, use good quality seeds, mulching recommended. <update>Also consider using organic pesticides like neem oil or soap sprays for aphids and white flies. Use fruit fly traps and pheromone lures for melon fly control. Implement crop rotation to reduce pest buildup.</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** <update>Powdery mildew, Downy mildew, Fusarium wilt</update>

**Symptoms:** <update>Powdery mildew: White powdery spots on leaves and stems. Downy mildew: Yellow spots on upper leaf surfaces, fuzzy gray growth on undersides. Fusarium wilt: Yellowing and wilting of leaves, stunted growth, brown discoloration in stem vascular tissue.</update>

**Management:** <update>Regularly monitor plants for signs of disease. For powdery and downy mildew, improve air circulation and avoid overhead watering. Apply fungicides if necessary. For Fusarium wilt, practice crop rotation, use disease-resistant varieties, and remove infected plants immediately. Maintain proper soil drainage and avoid overwatering to prevent all these diseases.Ï</update>


## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** The warm, humid conditions of the low country wet zone can support Kekiri growth, but excess moisture may pose challenges.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Requires well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging
- Higher risk of fungal diseases due to humidity; regular monitoring needed
- May need to implement raised beds or mounds for better drainage

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** The warm climate of the low country dry zone is suitable for Kekiri, but irrigation is crucial.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Requires consistent irrigation, especially during dry spells
- Mulching is essential to retain soil moisture
- May need shade during extreme heat to prevent fruit damage

### Mid country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** The moderate climate of the mid country provides favorable conditions for Kekiri cultivation.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- May require some irrigation during dry periods
- Basic pest and disease monitoring
- Attention to proper spacing and pruning for optimal growth

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Kekiri can be grown in the up country up to 1000m, but cooler temperatures present challenges.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Longer growing season due to cooler temperatures
- May require protection from frost in some areas during colder months
- Careful management of soil moisture to prevent waterlogging in higher rainfall areas
- Selection of varieties better suited to cooler climates may be necessary
