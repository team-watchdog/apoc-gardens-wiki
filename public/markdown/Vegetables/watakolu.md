## Description:
Watakolu is a _cucurbitaceous_ vine that is commercially grown for its unripe fruits as a vegetable. Watakolu is related to cucumbers, squash, pumpkins, and melons. Its fruit slightly resembles a cucumber or zucchini with ridges, and can be steamed, stewed or curried. Raw watakolu tastes somewhere between cucumber and zucchini. Many fruits grow on a single vine. Mature fruits are used as natural cleaning sponges.

In Sri Lanka, three main varieties are cultivated in home gardens and commercial farms across different agro-ecological zones.
- LA33
- Asiri
- Gannoruwa Ari

## Planting requirements

**Planting season:**
- Wet zone: Can be cultivated throughout the year
- Dry Zone: Mainly cultivated from October to January. Watakolu can also be cultivated successfully under irrigation from May to August

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Seeds |
|--------|----------------|
| Planting method | Soak the seeds in water for about 24 hours. Plant about 3-4 seeds per pit, fairly away from each other. Keep the seeds well watered. Before transplanting harrow the soil and break it finely. Mark pits to recommended spacing, 1.5m x 1.5m (between rows and between plants) . Make several deep drains to avoid excess water retention in field |
| Soil | Well-draining, sandy loam soil with organic matter. Soil pH should be around 5.5-7.5 for optimal growth. Set up trellises about 2m high using strong poles spaced about 3m apart. Train vines vertically or horizontally on ropes or wire. Remove side vines/water sprouts from the main stem |
| Water | Irrigate twice a day until seeds are germinated. After that, irrigation should be practiced according to soil moisture conditions |
| Light | Requires full sunlight |

### Growing conditions:
| Temperatures | Thrives in hot weather. Temperatures between 25-30°C are ideal for growth |
|--------|----------------|
| Soil | Well-draining, sandy loam soil with organic matter. Maintain pH between 5.5-7.5 |
| Water | After germination, water according to soil moisture conditions. Avoid waterlogging |
| Pruning | Use sharp, clean cutting tools for luffa pruning to prevent disease, trimming young plants to four stems and cutting them back to the main stem while pinching off the first male flowers to allow female flowers to develop fruit |
| Weed control | Luffa has a shallow root system, so take care not to damage the roots of the vines when controlling weeds |

## Harvesting:
Irrigate the evening before harvesting. Harvest around 14 days after flowering. Harvest with the stalk to avoid damaging the fruit. First harvesting can be done around 60-70 days after planting. 10-15 harvestings can be done over a period of 1½ – 2 months with 4-day intervals.

## Curing:
Avoid direct sunlight on harvested fruits. Pack in baskets to ensure good ventilation to prevent fruit damage. For sponge use, cure the fruits in the sun for about 3-5 days to harden them.

## Storage
Store cured Watakolu sponges in a dry, well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:**
- Melon Fruit Fly (*Bactrocera cucurbitae*)
- Red Pumpkin Beetle (*Aulacophora foveicollis*)
- Leaf Miner (*Liriomyza spp.*)

**Symptoms:**
- **Melon Fruit Fly:** Eggs are laid in flowers or developing fruits, resulting in larvae that feed on the internal contents, causing rotting and decay of the fruit. Infestation is more prevalent during the rainy season.
- **Red Pumpkin Beetle:** This beetle causes defoliation, especially in young plants, by feeding on leaf lamina. Grubs can damage underground stems and roots.
- **Leaf Miner:** Larvae create mines in leaves, leading to yellowing and eventual leaf drop. Severe infestations can stunt plant growth.

**Control method:**
- **Melon Fruit Fly:** Use traps and insecticides, and practice crop rotation to minimize populations. Regular monitoring and removal of infested fruits are also effective.
- **Red Pumpkin Beetle:** Deep ploughing after harvest can expose and kill grubs. Applying insecticides like Furadan near the base of seedlings can protect young plants.
- **Leaf Miner:** Mechanical removal of infested leaves and the use of yellow sticky traps can help control populations.

### Disease Control
**Disease type:**
- Powdery mildew (Podosphaera xanthii)
- Downy mildew (Pseudoperonospora cubensis)
- Collar rot/Root rot (Sclerotium spp., Fusarium spp.)
- Gummy Stem Blight (Didymella bryoniae)
- Bacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum)
- Leaf Curl Virus (LCV)
- Papaya Ring Spot Virus (PRSV)
- Cucumber Mosaic Virus (CMV)
- Zucchini Yellow Mosaic Virus (ZYMV)
- Phytoplasma disease of cucurbits

**Symptoms:**
- **Powdery mildew:** Pale yellow spots on older leaves; white, fluffy mycelium on leaf surfaces; brown and shrivelled leaves; defoliation
- **Downy mildew:** Angular yellow spots limited by leaf veins; chlorotic then necrotic leaves
- **Collar rot/Root rot:** Temporary wilting; yellowing leaves; drooping; plant death; yellow or brown vascular bundles in collar region
- **Gummy Stem Blight:** Water-soaked lesions on leaves and fruit; light brown irregular outlines; dark cracked sunken lesions on fruit; plant collapse; gummy exudates from stem cracks
- **Bacterial wilt:** Sudden drooping of leaves; whole plant wilting; brown, dry leaves; vascular discoloration; permanent wilting
- **Leaf Curl Virus:** Upward curling, shortening, and distortion of leaves; stunted plants; deformed fruits
- **Papaya Ring Spot Virus:** Leaf mosaic and mottling; leaf distortion; fruit malformation and size reduction; oily patches on fruit surface
- **Cucumber Mosaic Virus:** Green mottle; leaf deformation; green spots on fruits turning bright yellow; fruit malformation
- **Zucchini Yellow Mosaic Virus:** Stunting; yellowing; necrosis; mosaic; leaf deformations; fruit discolorations and deformations
- **Phytoplasma disease:** Smaller, thickened and yellowish green leaves; shortened internodes; plant stunting; witch's broom symptom; flower greening

**Management:**
- **Powdery mildew & Downy mildew:** Apply recommended fungicides; remove infected plant debris
- **Collar rot/Root rot:** Destroy infected plants with soil; improve drainage; use recommended fungicides
- **Gummy Stem Blight:** Plough crop debris deeply after harvest; apply recommended fungicides
- **Bacterial wilt:** Destroy infected plants with soil; practice crop rotation with non-susceptible crops; avoid equipment movement from infected to non-infected fields
- **Viral diseases:** Control insect vectors (whiteflies, aphids); remove infected plants; use disease-resistant varieties if available
- **Phytoplasma disease:** Remove infected plants; control leaf hoppers using recommended insecticides

In General:
- Maintain field sanitation
- Ensure proper drainage
- Practice crop rotation
- Use disease-resistant varieties when available
- Monitor plants regularly for early disease detection
- Implement integrated pest management strategies

## Difficulty Rating

### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Watakolu can be cultivated throughout the year in the wet zone, including areas like Colombo, Galle, and Ratnapura.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Monitor and manage fungal diseases due to high humidity
- Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging


### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Watakolu cultivation in the dry zone requires some irrigation management. This zone includes areas like Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, and Hambantota.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Implement efficient irrigation systems, especially during dry periods
- Use mulching to conserve soil moisture
- Provide shade during peak hours to prevent excessive heat stress

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Watakolu cultivation in the mid country requires some water balancing, but is otherwise quite doable. This zone includes areas like Kandy, Matale, and Badulla.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Balance water requirements to avoid both drought and waterlogging
- Monitor for pests and diseases regularly


### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Watakolu cultivation in the upcountry is challenging due to cooler temperatures, which are less ideal for this heat-loving crop. This zone includes areas like Nuwara Eliya and parts of Badulla.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Select warmer, sheltered locations for cultivation
- Use protective structures or greenhouses to maintain higher temperatures
- Provide additional support for vines to protect against strong winds
- Adjust planting times to coincide with warmer months
