## Description
Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus), known as "Bandakka" in Sinhala, is a nutritious vegetable widely cultivated in Sri Lanka. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces beautiful yellow flowers with crimson centers. The fruit is a tapering capsule containing numerous oval dark-colored seeds. Okra plants can grow up to 6 feet tall and have hairy stems. 

In Sri Lanka, okra is primarily grown for its edible immature seed pods, which are harvested when they are 2-4 inches long. These tender pods are a versatile ingredient in Sri Lankan cuisine:

Curries: Okra is commonly used in spicy curries, often cooked with coconut milk, a staple in Sri Lankan cooking.
Stir-fries: Quick-cooked okra dishes are popular as side dishes or accompaniments to rice.
Mallum: A traditional Sri Lankan dish where okra is finely chopped and mixed with grated coconut, onions, and spices.
Sambol: Okra is sometimes included in spicy sambols, a condiment served with rice and curry.

The Department of Agriculture has released several varieties suited to Sri Lankan growing conditions, including MI5, MI7, OKH1, and Haritha. These varieties are adapted to local climate and pest pressures, offering good yields for Sri Lankan farmers.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Okra can be grown throughout the year but planting seasons are early April to early May and early September to early October

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Direct Seeding |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Soak seeds in water for about 24 hours before sowing. Plant about 3-4 seeds per pit. After 2 weeks of seedling emergence, leave 2 healthy plants per pit and remove the excess. When transplanting mark pits with a spacing of 90 cm between rows and 60 cm between plants. Fill the pits with decomposed organic matter. Make several drains to avoid water retention/logging. Alternatively, you can plant okra in raised beds for better drainage |
| Soil | A well-drained soil that is neither acidic nor alkaline is suitable for successful growth of the plant. Okra prefers a soil pH between 6.0 and 7.0 |
| Water | Irrigate twice a day until seeds are germinated. Once established, okra plants require about an inch of water per week |
| Light | Okra needs full sun and hot weather. At least 6 hours of sunlight per day, with all-day sunshine being even better |

### Growing conditions:
| Temperatures | Temperatures below 15°C will be detrimental to the plant - they prefer a minimum temperature of 20°C. Okra is not frost tolerant and should be protected from temperatures below freezing |
|----|----|
| Soil | Mix well decomposed organic matter with soil. Adding compost or manure to the soil can also improve its fertility |
| Water | Irrigate according to moisture condition in the soil, maintaining sufficient moisture levels across the field. Okra plants are drought tolerant once established but will produce more pods with consistent watering |
| Pruning | Prune okra plants by removing any dead or diseased leaves and cutting back leggy growth to encourage bushier plants |
| Weed control | Hand-pulling or hoeing |

## Harvesting
Can be harvested every 2 days up to 25 times over 50-100 days after planting. Harvest in the morning with the stalk so as not to damage the plant. Sort and remove diseased, deformed, mature, and pest-affected pods. Avoid direct sunlight on harvested pods. Pack in baskets to ensure good ventilation. Harvest okra pods when they are about 3-4 inches long for best flavor.

## Curing
Okra does not require a curing stage

## Storage
Store okra in the refrigerator for up to a week. For longer storage, blanch and freeze okra pods.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** 
- Powdery Mildew
- Okra mosaic virus

**Symptoms:**
- Powdery Mildew: White patches on leaves that eventually turn yellow and die. First appears as whitish color powdery-like fungus parts on the lower side of the leaf. Yellowing on the upper side of the leaf, mainly on mature leaves and plant stem. Gradually, leaves are covered with whitish color powdery-like fungus. Finally, leaves dry out.

- Okra mosaic virus: Mosaic patterns on leaves, leaf distortion, and reduced plant growth. Yellowing of veins, reduced pod size, green and yellow color mosaic on leaves, leaf shriveling, stunting, and growth reduction.

**Control method:**
- Field sanitation (remove and destroy infected plants)
- Control of relative humidity and temperature
- Vector management: whitefly control, use of insect-proof net or cover cropping, usage of Neem extraction
- Use recommended seeds and resistant/tolerant varieties
- Proper instrument handling
- Use of recommended fungicides (for Powdery Mildew)
- Implement an IPM package including land preparation, crop rotation, proper plant spacing, nutrient management, improved drainage, and biological control

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** 
- Powdery Mildew (Podosphaera spp.)
- Okra mosaic virus (Begomovirus)

**Symptoms:**
- Powdery Mildew: White patches on leaves that eventually turn yellow and die. First appears as whitish color powdery-like fungus parts on the lower side of the leaf. Yellowing on the upper side of the leaf, mainly on mature leaves and plant stem. Gradually, leaves are covered with whitish color powdery-like fungus. Finally, leaves dry out.

- Okra mosaic virus: Mosaic patterns on leaves, leaf distortion, and reduced plant growth. Yellowing of veins, reduced pod size, green and yellow color mosaic on leaves, leaf shriveling, stunting, and growth reduction.

**Management:**
- Field sanitation (remove and destroy infected plants)
- Control of relative humidity and temperature
- Use recommended seeds and resistant/tolerant varieties
- Proper instrument handling
- Vector management for Okra mosaic virus (whitefly control)
- Use of insect-proof net or cover cropping
- Application of Neem extraction or Neem oil as a foliar spray
- Use of recommended fungicides for Powdery Mildew

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Okra can be cultivated successfully in the low country wet zone but requires careful water management to avoid waterlogging.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging. Consider planting okra on mounds or in raised beds for better drainage.
- Maintain sufficient moisture levels across the field. Okra plants require about an inch of water per week, so adjust irrigation accordingly.

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Okra can be cultivated successfully in the low country dry zone with adequate irrigation.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Irrigate according to moisture condition in the soil. Okra plants require about an inch of water per week, so adjust irrigation accordingly.
- Maintain sufficient moisture levels across the field. Consider using mulch around okra plants to retain soil moisture.

### Mid country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Okra can be cultivated successfully in the mid-country region with minimal challenges.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Monitor okra plants for pests and diseases and treat accordingly.

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Okra is not typically cultivated in the upcountry wet zone due to its preference for hot weather and full sun.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Avoid planting in areas with temperatures below 15°C. Consider providing row covers or other protection during cold periods.
- Provide adequate sunlight and heat to ensure successful growth. Okra plants require at least 6 hours of sunlight per day, so choose a sunny location for planting.
