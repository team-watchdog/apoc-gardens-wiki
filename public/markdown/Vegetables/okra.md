**Sri Lankan name:** Bandakka (Sinhala)
**Scientific name:** Okro Abelmoschus esculentus
**Plant family:** Malvaceae
**Edible parts:** Tender unripe fruit/pod is eaten as a vegetable. The leaves, flowers and seeds are also edible.
**Nutrition value:** Okra is nutritious with folate, vitamins, minerals especially calcium and iodine present in immature pods.<update>Okra is high in vitamin C, vitamin K, and folate. It's also a good source of magnesium, potassium, and manganese.</update>
**Companion plants:**
- Calendula
- Aromatic herbs and flowers: chamomile, wormwood, chives, summer savory, coriander, tansy, yarrow, dill, mint, thyme, hyssop, chervil, geranium, rue, sage, oregano
- Brassica plants: kale, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, Swiss chard
- Sunflowers
- Nasturtiums
**Non-companion plants:**
- Avoid growing squash, sweet potatoes, or solanaceous crops (like tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant) after okra (and vice versa), as they may be plagued by nematodes from the previous year.<update>Also avoid planting okra near beans, as both are susceptible to the same pests.</update>

## Description:
Okra is a nutritious vegetable with heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The fruit is a tapering capsule containing numerous oval dark-coloured seeds. The Department of Agriculture has released varieties MI5, MI7, OKH1, Haritha.<update>Okra plants can grow up to 6 feet tall and have hairy stems.</update>

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Okra can be grown throughout the year but planting seasons are Yala (early April to early May) and Maha (early September to early October).

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Direct Seeding: Soak seeds in water for about 24 hours before sowing. Plant about 3-4 seeds per pit. After 2 weeks of seedling emergence, leave 2 healthy plants per pit and remove the excess |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Mark pits with a spacing of 90 cm between rows and 60 cm between plants. Fill the pits with decomposed organic matter. Make several drains to avoid water retention/logging.<update>Alternatively, you can plant okra in raised beds for better drainage.</update> |
| Soil | A well-drained soil that is neither acidic nor alkaline is suitable for successful growth of the plant. The seed requirement is 4.5 kg/ha.<update>Okra prefers a soil pH between 6.0 and 7.0.</update> |
| Water | Irrigate twice a day until seeds are germinated.<update>Once established, okra plants require about an inch of water per week.</update> |
| Light | Okra needs full sun and hot weather. At least 6 hours of sunlight per day, with all-day sunshine being even better.<update>Okra prefers temperatures between 70°F to 95°F (21°C to 35°C).</update> |

### Growing conditions:

| Temperatures | Temperatures below 15 ℃ will be detrimental to the plant - they prefer a minimum temperature of 20 ℃.<update>Okra is not frost tolerant and should be protected from temperatures below freezing.</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | Mix 10 t/ha of well decomposed organic matter with soil<update>Adding compost or manure to the soil can also improve its fertility.</update> |
| Water | Irrigate according to moisture condition in the soil, maintaining sufficient moisture levels across the field.<update>Okra plants are drought tolerant once established but will produce more pods with consistent watering.</update> |
| Pruning | Not specified<update>Prune okra plants by removing any dead or diseased leaves and cutting back leggy growth to encourage bushier plants.</update> |

## Harvesting:
Can be harvested every 2 days up to 25 times over 50-100 days after planting. Harvest in the morning with the stalk so as not to damage the plant. Sort and remove diseased, deformed, mature, and pest-affected pods. Avoid direct sunlight on harvested pods. Pack in baskets to ensure good ventilation and safe transport.<update>Harvest okra pods when they are about 3-4 inches long for best flavor.</update>

## Curing:
Not specified<update>There is no curing process required for okra. It can be eaten fresh or stored as is.</update>

## Storage
Not specified<update>Store okra in the refrigerator for up to a week. For longer storage, blanch and freeze okra pods.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Powdery Mildew, Okra mosaic virus

**Symptoms:**
<update>
- Powdery Mildew: White patches on leaves that eventually turn yellow and die.
- Okra mosaic virus: Mosaic patterns on leaves, leaf distortion, and reduced plant growth.
</update>

**Control method:**
- Field sanitation (remove and destroy infected plants)
- Control of relative humidity and temperature
- Vector management: whitefly/use of insect proof net or cover cropping/usage of Neem extraction<update>Neem oil can also be used as a foliar spray to control pests.</update>
- Use recommended seeds and resistant/tolerant varieties<update>Consider using disease-resistant varieties like 'Clemson Spineless' or 'Annie Oakley'.</update>
- Proper instrument handling

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** Not specified

**Symptoms:** Not specified

**Management:**
- Land preparation
- Crop rotation
- Resistant varieties<update>Rotate crops with marigolds to help control soil-borne diseases.</update>
- Use disease-free seeds
- Plant spacing
- Nutrient management
- Improve drainage
- Field sanitation (remove and destroy infected plants)
- Biological control<update>Encourage natural predators like ladybugs and lacewings to control pests.</update>

## Difficulty Rating

### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Okra can be cultivated successfully in the low country wet zone but requires careful water management to avoid waterlogging.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging.<update>Consider planting okra on mounds or in raised beds for better drainage.</update>
- Maintain sufficient moisture levels across the field.<update>Okra plants require about an inch of water per week, so adjust irrigation accordingly.</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Okra can be cultivated successfully in the low country dry zone with adequate irrigation.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Irrigate according to moisture condition in the soil.<update>Okra plants require about an inch of water per week, so adjust irrigation accordingly.</update>
- Maintain sufficient moisture levels across the field.<update>Consider using mulch around okra plants to retain soil moisture.</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Okra can be cultivated successfully in the mid-country region with minimal challenges.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- No significant challenges mentioned for this zone.<update>However, monitor okra plants for pests and diseases and treat accordingly.</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Okra is not typically cultivated in the upcountry wet zone due to its preference for hot weather and full sun.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Avoid planting in areas with temperatures below 15 ℃.<update>Consider providing row covers or other protection during cold periods.</update>
- Provide adequate sunlight and heat to ensure successful growth.<update>Okra plants require at least 6 hours of sunlight per day, so choose a sunny location for planting.</update>
