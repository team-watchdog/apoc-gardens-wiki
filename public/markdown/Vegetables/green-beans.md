## Description:
Green beans, also called "string beans" or "snap beans," are tender annuals. Though most green beans are indeed green, they also come in purple, red, yellow, and streaked varieties. Their growing style is classified as "bush" or "pole." Bush beans grow compactly while Pole beans grow as climbing vines. In Sri Lanka, both types are cultivated, with pole beans being particularly popular in home gardens.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Year-round in most parts of Sri Lanka, with the best seasons being March-April and November-December

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Seeds |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Sow bush beans 1 inch deep and 2 inches apart in rows 18 inches apart. Sow pole beans 1 inch deep, placing them around supports |
| Soil | Need a well-drained loamy soil that has been improved by compost and a pH of about 6.5. Incorporating compost when digging the soil is better. Better to prepare the soil about a week before planting. Avoid using high nitrogen fertilizer |
| Water | Need to keep the beans well watered otherwise they will stop flowering |
| Light | Needs full sunshine for most part of the day |

### Growing conditions:
| Temperatures | Thrives in temperatures between 18°C to 30°C, which is common in most parts of Sri Lanka |
|----|----|
| Soil | Keep the bed well-weeded and the soil loose. Mulch soil around bean plants to retain moisture but keep it well drained. Beans have shallow roots, so mulch keeps them cool |
| Water | Water regularly, about 2 inches per square foot per week. Better to water them on a sunny day so that foliage will not remain soaked, which could encourage disease. Drip irrigation system recommended |
| Pruning | Pinching off the tips of plants after they have produced pods can encourage further production. |
| Weed control | Hand-pull weeds or use organic herbicides to keep weeds at bay |

## Harvesting:
Days to harvest range from 50 to 70 days. Green beans are picked young and tender before the seeds inside have fully developed.

## Curing:
Green beans do not require a curing stage.

## Storage
Store green beans in a plastic bag in the refrigerator crisper drawer for up to 7 days (the plastic bag ensures moisture retention). For longer storage, blanch beans in boiling water for 3 minutes and cool in ice water for 3 minutes. Drain and package to keep in the freezer.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control

- **Armyworms:** Circular holes in foliage; skeletonized leaves; shallow wounds on fruit; egg clusters on leaves
- **Corn earworm:** Damage to leaves, buds, flowers, pods and beans; young caterpillars cream-white with black head; older larvae yellow-green to black with fine white lines
- **Cutworms:** Severed stems of young plants; irregular holes in fruits; larvae curl into C-shape when disturbed
- **Leafminers:** Thin, white, winding trails on leaves; white blotches; premature leaf drop
- **Loopers:** Large or small holes in leaves; pale green caterpillars with white lines; distinctive arching movement
- **Mexican bean beetle:** Irregular patches on leaf undersides; lacy leaf appearance; damage to flowers and pods
- **Stinkbugs:** Dark pinpricks on fruit surrounded by lighter area; secondary infections and fruit decay
- **Spider mites:** Yellow stippling on leaves; bronzed appearance; webbing on leaves; tiny moving dots visible with hand lens

**Control method:**
- **General:** Monitor plants regularly; remove plant debris; use resistant varieties when available
- **Aphids:** Prune infested parts; use reflective mulches; spray with strong water jet; apply insecticidal soaps or neem oil
- **Armyworms:** Encourage natural enemies; apply Bacillus thuringiensis
- **Corn earworm:** Monitor for eggs and larvae; apply Bacillus thuringiensis or Entrust SC for organic control
- **Cutworms:** Remove plant residue; use protective collars around stems; hand-pick larvae at night; apply diatomaceous earth around plant base
- **Leafminers:** Check transplants before planting; remove plants after harvest; use insecticides only when necessary
- **Loopers:** Hand-pick larvae; apply Bacillus thuringiensis
- **Mexican bean beetle:** Plant early varieties; remove overwintering sites; hand-pick adults and larvae; destroy eggs
- **Stinkbugs:** Remove weeds around crop; use insecticidal soaps or kaolin clay; preserve natural enemies
- **Spider mites:** Maintain proper irrigation; spray plants with water jet; apply insecticidal soap if necessary

### Disease Control

**Disease type:**
- Alternaria leaf spot
- Anthracnose
- Bean rust
- Black root rot
- Fusarium root rot
- White mold (Sclerotinia timber rot)
- Bacterial blight
- Bacterial brown spot
- Halo blight
- Damping-off
- Mosaic (Bean common mosaic virus, Bean common mosaic necrosis virus)

**Symptoms:**
- **Alternaria leaf spot:** Small brown lesions on leaves; lesions expand and turn gray-brown with concentric zones
- **Anthracnose:** Dark brown to black lesions on cotyledons, stems, and pods; sunken cankers; reddish-brown spots on pods
- **Bean rust:** Small yellow/white spots on leaves; raised brick red rust pustules; premature leaf drop
- **Black root rot:** Red-purple lesions on roots turning dark gray to black; stunted growth; wilting; defoliation
- **Fusarium root rot:** Stunted plants; chlorotic leaves; leaf drop; decayed, hollow roots
- **White mold:** White, cottony fungal growth on flowers; dark green, water-soaked lesions; plant death
- **Bacterial blight:** Water-soaked spots on leaves; necrotic areas with yellow borders; sunken lesions on pods
- **Bacterial brown spot:** Dark brown necrotic spots on leaves; water-soaked spots on pods; pod distortion
- **Halo blight:** Small water-soaked spots on leaves; chlorotic halos; distorted leaves; lesions on pods
- **Damping-off:** Seed rot; seedling death; stunting and yellowing of older plants; reddish-brown lesions on roots and stems

- **Bacterial brown spot:** Remove crop debris after harvest
- **Halo blight:** Treat seeds with antibiotics; plow bean debris deeply after harvest
- **Damping-off:** Sow seeds in warm, well-prepared soil; treat seeds with fungicide
- **Mosaic:** Plant virus-free seed; use resistant varieties

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Green beans can be challenging in the wet zone due to high humidity and potential fungal diseases.
- **Challenges/Adaptations:**
  - Provide good air circulation around plants, use disease-resistant varieties, and avoid overhead watering.
  - Use raised beds to improve drainage and consider plastic mulch to reduce soil splash.
    
### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Green beans grow well in the dry zone with adequate irrigation.
- **Challenges/Adaptations:**
  - Ensure consistent moisture, protect from strong winds, and provide shade during peak heat hours.
  - Use mulch to conserve soil moisture and consider drip irrigation for efficient water use.

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Green beans can be moderately challenging in the mid-country due to varying temperatures and potential pests.
- **Challenges/Adaptations:**
  - Monitor for pests, maintain consistent moisture, and provide some shade during peak heat hours.

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Green beans can be challenging in the up-country due to cooler temperatures and potential frost damage.
- **Challenges/Adaptations:**
  - Provide protection from frost, ensure adequate sunlight, and maintain consistent moisture.
