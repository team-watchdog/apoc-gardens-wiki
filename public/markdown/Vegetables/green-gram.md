## Description:
Green Gram Bean is an upright hairy bean plant which can reach up to 1 m tall. The leaves have 3 leaflets and are dark green. The leaves are on long leaf stalks. There are oval stipules at the base of the leaf. It has small flowers that are pale yellow in colour and occur in bunches of 10–20 on the ends of long hairy stalks. The pods are black and straight. The pods contain 10– 20 seeds which are usually green or golden yellow. The beans can be black. They have a flat white hilum. There are approximately 2,000 varieties.

## Planting requirements
The plant will grow from sea level up to probably 2000 m in the tropics. It is drought resistant and can't stand water-logging. Plants are damaged by frost. They cannot stand high salinity and rainfall at flowering is detrimental.

**Planting season:** The green gram is a summer season crop and hence can be grown in warm and humid climate 

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Plants are grown from seeds and the seeds can be germinated for sprouts. Seeds germinate in 3–5 days.                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Planting method | Seeds can be scattered in broad area or can be sown in small plots often 2–3 seeds in holes 50–60 cm apart. Seeding rates of 6 to 22 kg per ha are used in different locations. It normally requires phosphorus fertiliser for adequate growth |
| Soil            | Green grams thrive in a well-drained soil, rich in nutrients and a pH from 4.3-8.1. Weeds consume nutrients from the soil. So weed should be removed when preparing the soil. Mulch with rice straw.                                           |
| Water           | Need to maintain moisture throughout depending upon soil type and climatic conditions.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Light           | Need sunshine hour between 3.5 to 8.5 hr                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Growing conditions:
You're right, I apologize for the confusion. Let me correct that part:

### Growing conditions:
| Temperatures | It can grow where annual temperatures are from 8°C to 28°C                                                                                |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Soil         | Green gram is cultivated in deep soil. Preferably loamy soil and sandy loamy soil. Water logging should be avoided.                       |
| Water        | Excessive watering can damage the yield. So stop watering 55 days after sowing the seeds. 5 to 6 irrigation is required in summer season. |
<update>| Pruning      | Green gram does not require pruning. It's an annual crop that completes its lifecycle in one growing season.                              |
| Weed control | Regular weeding is essential, especially during the first 3-4 weeks after sowing. Use shallow cultivation or mulching to suppress weeds. Hand weeding is preferred to avoid damaging the shallow root system. |</update>

## Harvesting
Green pods are ready after about 2 months and ripe pods may take another 1–2 months. For ripe beans the whole plant is harvested and dried before threshing. Yields of 450–560 kg/ha of seeds are common.

<update>
## Curing
After harvesting, green gram beans should be dried thoroughly in the sun for 3-4 days until the moisture content is reduced to about 10-12%. This helps prevent mold growth and improves storage life.
</update>

<update>
## Storage
Store dried green gram beans in airtight containers in a cool, dry place. Properly stored, they can last for up to a year. For longer storage, keep containers in a refrigerator or freezer to maintain quality and prevent insect infestation.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Anthracnose, Aphids, Bacterial blight, Bean flies, Cowpea seed beetle, Damping-off diseases, Foliage beetles, Mungbean Yellow mosaic virus, Pod sucking bugs, Pod-borers, Powdery mildew, Rust, Storage pests, Thrips, Whiteflies
<update>**Symptoms:** Yellowing or mottling of leaves, stunted growth, wilting, leaf curling, holes in leaves or pods, presence of insects on plant parts, white powdery coating on leaves, rust-colored spots on leaves, and discolored or shriveled seeds.</update>
**Control method:** Crop rotation, spray neem extract

### Disease Control
<update>**Disease type:** Bacterial blight, Powdery mildew, Anthracnose, Yellow Mosaic Virus</update>
<update>**Symptoms:** Leaf spots, wilting, yellowing of leaves, white powdery growth on leaves, dark lesions on stems and pods, yellow mosaic pattern on leaves</update>
<update>**Management:** Use disease-resistant varieties, practice crop rotation, maintain proper plant spacing for good air circulation, remove and destroy infected plant parts, apply appropriate fungicides if necessary, and control insect vectors for viral diseases</update>

## Difficulty Rating
<update>
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Green gram is well-suited to the wet zone, but excessive rainfall can lead to waterlogging. Good drainage is essential. The humid conditions may increase the risk of fungal diseases, so vigilant monitoring is necessary.

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 3/10)
**Explanation:** Green gram thrives in the dry zone. The plant's drought resistance makes it ideal for this climate. Ensure adequate irrigation during dry spells, especially during flowering and pod formation stages.

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Green gram can be successfully grown in the mid country. The moderate climate is suitable, but attention to irrigation and pest management is crucial. The varied topography may require adjustments in planting techniques.

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Growing green gram in the up country can be challenging due to cooler temperatures and potential frost. Choose sheltered locations with good sunlight exposure. The growing season may be shorter, affecting yields.
