## General Information
**Generic name:** Moringa, Drumstick
**Sri Lankan name:** Murunga (Sinhala) | Mōriṅkā (Tamil)
**Scientific name:** _Moringa Oleifera_
**Plant family:** _Moringaceae_
**Edible parts:** Leaves, pods, seeds, roots, and flowers. The thickened root can be used as a substitute for horseradish. Seeds can be eaten like peanuts and yield edible oil known as "ben oil".

- 4 times the vitamin A of carrots
- 4 times the calcium of milk
- 3 times the potassium of bananas
- 2 times the protein of yogurt
- More iron than spinach

## Description:
It is a small tree up to 9-12 m high with a trunk of 60 cm across. It has feather-like divided leaves that have a pale colour and a grey, thick bark. The bark is corky and peels off in patches. The flowers are pale yellow and contain both sexes. The seed capsules are up to 45 cm long. They are roughly triangular in shape and split open when dry. Pruning is necessary to maintain the tree at the size you want it to be. There are two drumstick varieties; annual and perennial.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Year-round, but best during the rainy season, October to December in the wet zone and April to May in the dry zone

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Cuttings (perennial variety) or seeds (annual variety) |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Dig pits of size 45 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm with a spacing of 2.0 - 2.5 m either way. Apply compost after mixing with top soil. For better results, prepare planting pits 30-50 cm wide and deep, water, and fill with topsoil mixed with compost or manure before planting |
| Soil | A soil with a pH balance of 6.3-7.5 is suitable. It grows well in a wide range of soil but a deep, well-draining sandy loamy soil is ideal for cultivating the crop |
| Water | Keep the soil consistently moist, but not wet. Established plants are drought-tolerant, but young plants need consistent moisture to encourage strong growth. They cannot tolerate water-logging |
| Light | Needs a bright, sunny location that receives direct sunlight throughout the day. Growth may be stunted if the plants do not receive enough light |

### Growing conditions:
| Temperatures | Thrives in temperatures between 25-35°C, common in most parts of Sri Lanka. Can tolerate up to 48°C in shade |
|----|----|
| Soil | Moringa trees are adaptable to a wide range of soils and can survive in poor soils if needed. However, they thrive in well-draining, sandy soils. As the plant is sensitive to root rot, they will not thrive in overly compacted soil or soil that holds too much moisture. Add compost or cow manure to soil when planting to provide needed nutrients |
| Water | Infrequent, deep watering is better than frequent, light watering. Saplings will need more water than established trees. Keep the soil moist around them by watering every 2-3 days |
| Pruning | Regular pruning of damaged portions helps maintain tree size and encourages bushier growth. When the seedlings reach a height of 60 cm, pinch the terminal growing tip 10 cm from the top. This encourages branching and can be repeated with secondary and tertiary branches to create a bushy, productive tree |
| Weed control | Hand-pulling or hoeing |

## Harvesting:
Moringa pods can be harvested for fresh eating when they're about six inches in length and 1 cm in diameter. At this young, undeveloped size, the entire pod is edible as are the immature seeds within. These are often cooked like string beans. Mature pods can be harvested at full size. 

Leaves can be extracted in abundance and can be cooked, made into salads and made into dried powder. For making leaf sauces, harvest seedlings, growing tips, or young leaves.

When producing seed for planting or for oil extraction, allow the pods to dry and turn brown on the tree. Harvest before they split open and seeds fall to the ground.

## Curing:
The leaves can be sun dried by covering with a cheese cloth to avoid pests. Each night take indoors to avoid rehydration of dried leaves.

## Storage: 
Fresh leaves can be stored in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:**
- Bud worm (*Noorda moringae*)
- Leaf caterpillar (*Noorda blitealis*)
- Hairy caterpillar (*Eupterote mollifera*)
- Pod fly (*Gitona distigma*)
- Bark caterpillar (*Indarbela tetraonis*)

**Symptoms:**
- **Bud worm:** Larva bores into flower buds and causes shedding.
- **Leaf caterpillar:** Larva feeds on the leaflets reducing them into papery structures.
- **Hairy caterpillar:** Larva seen in groups in tree trunks. Feed gregariously. Scraping the bark and gnawing foliage. Severe infestation leads to defoliation of the tree.
- **Pod fly:** Drying and splitting of fruits from tip. Oozing of gummy exudate from fruit.
- **Bark caterpillar:** Zig-zag galleries and silken webbed masses comprising of chewed material and excreta of larva.

**Control method:**
- **Bud worm and Leaf caterpillar:** 
  - Plough around trees to expose and kill pupae
  - Collect and destroy damaged buds along with caterpillar
  - Set up light trap
- **Hairy caterpillar:** 
  - Collect and destroy egg masses and caterpillars
  - Set up light trap to attract and kill adults immediately after rain
  - Use burning torch to kill congregating larvae on the trunk
- **Pod fly:** 
  - Collect and destroy all the fallen and damaged fruits
  - Use attractants like citronella oil, eucalyptus oil, vinegar (Acetic acid), dextrose or lactic acid
  - Rake up the soil under the trees or plough the infested field to destroy puparia
- **Bark caterpillar:** 
  - Clean all webbed material and excreta
  - Plug the holes with cotton wool soaked in fumigants like chloroform, formalin or petrol and seal it with mud    

### Disease Control
**Disease type:**
- Powdery mildew
- Root rot
- Anthracnose
- Diplodia root rot

**Symptoms:**
- **Powdery mildew:** White spots on leaves that eventually cover the entire leaf surface.
- **Root rot:** Yellowing leaves and wilting.
- **Anthracnose:** Brown spots on leaves, light pink and gray spots on infected stems.
- **Diplodia root rot:** Severe wilting and death of plants, especially in waterlogged soils.

**Management:**
- **Powdery mildew:** Avoid overhead watering, provide good air circulation, and apply fungicides if necessary.
- **Root rot:** Improve soil drainage and reduce watering frequency.
- **Anthracnose:** Prune and burn infected plant parts. Apply recommended protective and systemic fungicides.
- **Diplodia root rot:** Ensure proper drainage and avoid waterlogging.

## Medicinal Properties and Uses
Moringa has numerous medicinal properties:
- Leaves can improve milk production for pregnant and lactating mothers.
- Leaf juice has a stabilizing effect on blood pressure and can help control glucose levels in diabetic patients.
- Various parts of the plant are used to treat headaches, glandular swelling, skin infections, and as a diuretic.

## Intercropping
Moringa trees can be planted in gardens to provide support for climbing crops such as pole beans (use only mature trees for this purpose). They can also provide shade for vegetables less tolerant to direct sunlight. Choose shade-tolerant leafy vegetables and herbs for intercropping, as moringa can be highly competitive.

## Difficulty Rating

### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Moringa trees grow well in the warm, humid conditions of the wet zone.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure proper drainage to prevent root rot.
- Monitor and manage fungal diseases due to high humidity.
- Implement regular pruning to maintain air circulation and reduce disease risk.

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 3/10)
**Explanation:** Moringa trees are well-suited to the dry zone's climate, being drought-tolerant once established.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide regular watering during the dry season, especially for young plants.
- Mulch around the base to retain soil moisture.
- Protect from strong winds, which can damage the tree.

### Mid country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Moringa trees grow well in the varied conditions of the mid country, benefiting from moderate temperatures and rainfall.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure proper drainage in areas with higher rainfall.
- Provide wind protection in exposed areas.
- Balance water needs during both dry and wet seasons.

### Up country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** While moringa can grow in the cooler temperatures of the up country, growth may be slower and require more care.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Choose sheltered locations with good sun exposure to maximize warmth.
- Protect from strong winds and heavy rains.
- Be prepared to provide extra care during cooler periods to encourage growth.
