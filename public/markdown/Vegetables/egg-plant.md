## Description:
Egg plants have a luxuriant purple colour with flowers of the same colour and have large leaves. <update>In Sri Lanka, various local varieties are grown, including the popular 'Thirunelveli' and 'Anjalee' cultivars, which are well-adapted to local conditions.</update>

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>Year-round in Sri Lanka, with peak planting during the Yala season (March to August) and Maha season (September to March).</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Sow the seed indoors about ten weeks before you plant out. Soak the seeds overnight and then plant the seeds in a pot filled with potting soil. |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Planting method | Transplant seedlings into prepared beds after 3-4 weeks, when they have 4-5 true leaves.                                                        |
| Soil            | Requires deep rich soil with plenty of moisture, but it does not thrive in wet weather. pH should be around 6.0-6.8.                            |
| Water           | Water lightly to retain moisture. If it receives inadequate water, it will develop small, bitter fruits.                                        |
| Light           | Moderate sunshine                                                                                                                               |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Grow in daytime temperature between 26 and 32°C (80–90°F) and night time temperatures around 21°C (70°F).                    |
|-----------------:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|             Soil | Dig plenty of manure or compost into your soil. Eggplants like a pH of about 6.0                                             |
|            Water | Keep them well watered but don’t overwater. Need at least an inch of water per week, and up to two inches during hot season. |
|          Pruning | Pinch off growing tips when plants are 12-15 inches tall to encourage branching and more fruit production.                   |
|     Weed control | Keep the area around plants weed-free to prevent competition for nutrients and moisture.                                     |

## Harvesting:
Cut them off without pulling them as soon as they have a bloom, before they are fully grown. The plants will then continue to fruit. <update>In Sri Lanka, harvesting usually begins 60-70 days after transplanting.</update>

## Curing:
<update>Allow eggplants to cure at room temperature for a few days to improve flavor and reduce bitterness.
</update>

## Storage: 
<update>Store in the refrigerator crisper drawer for up to 1 week.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Flea Beetle
**Symptoms:** <update>Wilting of shoots and circular holes on fruits.</update>
**Control method:** These pests may attack when the plants are young. The leaves are quickly eaten away if they are not checked. Use derris dust to get rid of them.

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** <update>Bacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum)</update>

**Symptoms:** <update>Sudden wilting of plants, especially during hot and humid conditions.</update>

**Management:** <update>Use resistant varieties, practice crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops, and ensure good drainage.</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Eggplants can be challenging to grow in the wet zone due to high humidity and risk of fungal diseases.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Keep plants dry, especially around the base.
- Provide good air circulation.
<update>- Use raised beds to improve drainage.</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Eggplants can be moderately difficult in the dry zone due to high temperatures and low humidity.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure consistent moisture.
- Provide shade during peak heat hours.
<update>- Use drip irrigation for efficient water use.</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Eggplants are relatively easy to grow in the mid-country with its moderate climate.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Maintain even watering.
- Protect from strong winds.
<update>- Implement trellising for better fruit quality.</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Eggplants can be challenging to grow in the upcountry due to cooler temperatures and shorter growing seasons.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide additional warmth with row covers or black plastic mulch.
- Ensure adequate sunlight.
<update>- Choose early-maturing varieties suitable for cooler climates.</update>
