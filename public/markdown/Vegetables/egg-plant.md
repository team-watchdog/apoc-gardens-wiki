## Description:
Eggplants have a luxuriant purple colour with flowers of the same colour and have large leaves. Can be grown in regions at 1300m above sea level. Several special varieties like Amanda, Anjali, HORDI Lenairi, Thinnaweli purple, and padagoda are suitable for Sri Lankan conditions.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Eggplant can be grown throughout the year. Most favourable seasons are from March to August and September to March

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Sow the seed indoors about ten weeks before you plant out. Soak the seeds overnight and then plant the seeds in a pot filled with potting soil |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Transplant seedlings into prepared beds after 3-4 weeks when they have 4-5 true leaves |
| Soil | Requires deep rich soil with plenty of moisture, but it does not thrive in wet weather. pH level should be around 6.0-6.8 |
| Water | Water lightly to retain moisture. If it receives inadequate water, it will develop small, bitter fruits |
| Light | Moderate sunshine |

### Growing conditions:
| Temperatures | Grow in daytime temperature between 26 and 32°C (80–90°F) and night time temperatures around 21°C (70°F) |
|----|----|
| Soil | Apply plenty of manure or compost into your soil. Eggplants like a pH level of about 6.0 |
| Water | Keep them well watered but don’t overwater. Need at least an inch of water per week, and up to two inches during hot season |
| Pruning | Pinch off growing tips when plants are 12-15 inches tall to encourage branching and more fruit production |
| Weed control | Keep the area around plants weed-free to prevent competition for nutrients and moisture |

## Harvesting:
Harvest eggplants by cutting them off cleanly without pulling them as soon as they have a bloom before they are fully grown. The plants will then continue to fruit.

## Curing:
Eggplant does not require a curing stage.

## Storage: 
Eggplants do not like cool temperatures, so it is recommended to harvest and use immediately for the best flavor. If you must store them, wrap them in plastic and store them for one to two days in the refrigerator.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** 
- Flea Beetle
  
**Symptoms:**
- These pests may attack when the plants are young. The leaves are quickly eaten away if they are not checked.
  
**Control method:**
-  Use derris dust to remove the Flea Beetles.

### Disease Control

**Disease type:**
- Damping-off (_Pythium spp._, _Phytophthora spp._, _Fusarium spp._, _Rhizoctonia spp._, _Sclerotium rolfsii_)
- Collar rot (_Sclerotium rolfsii_)
- Fusarium wilt (_Fusarium oxysporum f.sp lycopersici_)
- Powdery mildew (_Podosphaera xanthii_)
- Anthracnose (_Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_)
- Bacterial wilt (_Ralstonia solanacearum_)
- Little leaf disease (Phytoplasma)

**Symptoms:**
- **Damping-off:** 
  - Sudden collapsing of seedlings at the base of the stem
  - Root rot and seedling death
  - Brownish-black discoloration at the base (for _Rhizoctonia spp._)

- **Collar rot:** 
  - Yellowing of leaves
  - Decaying near the collar region
  - White or brown fungal growth (sclerotia) on the collar region

- **Fusarium wilt:** 
  - Yellowing of leaves and wilting
  - Vascular discoloration of stem
  - Root rot and dying of the plant

- **Powdery mildew:** 
  - Circular yellow patches on lower leaf surface
  - White powdery residue on upper leaf surface

- **Anthracnose:** 
  - Sunken circular lesions with tan to orange to black concentric rings
  - Pink masses of spores oozing from lesions

- **Bacterial wilt:** 
  - Slight wilting of single branch or branches
  - Sudden and permanent wilting of the entire plant
  - Discoloration of vascular tissues
  - Slimy bacterial ooze from cut ends when immersed in clear water

- **Little leaf disease:** 
  - Narrow, soft, smooth, and yellow leaves
  - Shortened internodes
  - Bushy appearance due to enlarged axillary buds
  - Green or no flowers
  - Rare fruiting

**Management:**
- **Damping-off:** 
  - Prepare nursery beds in well-drained virgin soil
  - Sterilize nursery soil (burning, solarization, or chemicals)
  - Remove affected plants with surrounding soil
  - Treat seeds before planting
  - Apply fungicides to the soil around plant bases

- **Collar rot and Fusarium wilt:** 
  - Destroy affected plants with surrounding soil
  - Improve drainage
  - Deep plow the land and expose the affected soil to sunlight
  - Avoid root damage when transplanting
  - Apply fungicides to the soil around plant bases

- **Powdery mildew:** 
  - Apply recommended fungicides at the initial stage of disease development. Use sulfur, chlorothalonil, or carbendazim-based products

- **Anthracnose:** 
  - Use healthy seeds
  - Avoid excess overhead irrigation
  - Remove and destroy infected fruits
  - Treat seeds before planting
  - Apply fungicides starting at the flowering stage in the rainy season

- **Bacterial wilt:**
  - Remove and destroy affected plants with soil
  - Destroy crop debris after harvesting
  - Rotate with non-susceptible crops (cruciferous vegetables and okra)
  - Use resistant varieties if available
  - Disinfect all farm tools with bleach
  - No effective chemical control method

- **Little leaf disease:** 
  - Remove and burn infected plants
  - Control leaf hoppers (disease vectors) with recommended insecticides

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Eggplants can be challenging to grow in the wet zone due to high humidity and risk of fungal diseases.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Keep plants dry, especially around the base.
- Provide good air circulation.
- Use raised beds to improve drainage.

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Eggplants can be moderately difficult in the dry zone due to high temperatures and low humidity.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure consistent moisture.
- Provide shade during peak heat hours.

### Mid country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Eggplants are relatively easy to grow in the mid-country with its moderate climate.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Maintain even watering.
- Protect from strong winds.
  
### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Eggplants can be challenging to grow in the upcountry due to cooler temperatures and shorter growing seasons.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide additional warmth with row covers or black plastic mulch.
- Ensure adequate sunlight.
