## Description:
Luffa acutangula is a cucurbitaceous vine that is commercially grown for its unripe fruits as a vegetable. Mature fruits are used as natural cleaning sponges<update> and are a common sight in Sri Lankan markets</update>. Its fruit slightly resembles a cucumber or zucchini with ridges. It ranges from central and eastern Asia to southeastern Asia. <update>In Sri Lanka, it is widely cultivated in home gardens and commercial farms across different agro-ecological zones.</update>

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>Wet zone – Can be cultivated throughout the year. Dry Zone – Mainly cultivated in Maha Season (October to January), can be cultivated successfully under irrigation in Yala season (May to August).</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Soak the seeds in water for about 24 hours. Plant about 3-4 seeds per pit, fairly away from each other. Keep the seeds well watered. After 2 weeks of seedling emergence leave two healthy plants and remove the rest. <update>For good results vines should be trained in trellises about 2m high. For this setup, construct the trellises vertically or horizontally with ropes or wire. Set up strong poles to a spacing of about 3m.</update> |
|----|----|
| Planting method | <update>Well-Draining, sandy loam soil with organic matter is ideal for cultivation. Soil pH should be around 5.5 -7.5 for optimal growth. Harrow the soil and break it finely and mark pits with 1.5 meters between rows and 1.5 meters between plants. Make several deep drains to avoid excess water retention in field.</update> |
| Soil | Well-Draining, sandy loam soil with organic matter is ideal for cultivation. Soil pH should be around 5.5 -7.5 for optimal growth |
| Water | <update>Irrigate twice a day until seeds are germinated. After that irrigation should be practiced according to moisture condition in the soil. Ideally once a week.</update> |
| Light | Requires sunlight |

### Growing conditions:

| Temperatures | <update>Excessive heat may cause wilting. In Sri Lanka, temperatures between 25-30°C are ideal for growth.</update> |

| Propagation | <update>Direct seeding to pre-marked pits is the most common method in Sri Lanka.</update> |

## Harvesting:
<update>Irrigate previous day evening before harvesting. Harvesting can be done around 14 days after flowering. Harvest with the stalk as not to damage the fruit. First harvesting can be taken around 60-70 days after planting. 10-15 harvesting can be done over a period of 1 ½ – 2 months with 4 days interval of harvesting.</update>

## Curing:
<update>After harvesting, cure the fruits in the sun for about 3-5 days to harden them and make them suitable for use as sponges. This is a common practice in Sri Lankan households.</update>

## Storage
<update>Store cured luffa sponges in a dry, well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight. They can last for several years with proper care. In Sri Lanka, they are often hung in bathrooms or kitchens for easy access.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Leaf miners, brown spot, yellow spot

**Symptoms:**
<update>
- Leaf miners: Relatively harmless at first but can quickly multiply and devastate plants.
- Brown spot: Causes leaf spotting and defoliation if severe.
- Yellow spot: Caused by fungus or bacteria.
</update>
**Control method:**

*Leaf miners:*
1. Spray an organic insecticide (azadirachtin).
2. Introduce beneficial insects (parasitic wasps, Syrphid flies).

*Brown spot:* <update>Remove infected leaves and apply organic treatment options, such as neem oil or garlic spray, working up to synthetic fungicides if necessary.</update>

*Yellow spot:* <update>Remove infected plant parts and apply recommended chemicals for fungal infections or streptomycin for bacterial infections. Consult local agricultural extension services for specific recommendations.</update>

### Disease Control
<update>
**Disease type:** Powdery mildew

**Symptoms:** White powdery spots on leaves, which can spread and cause leaf drop if severe.

**Management:**
- Maintain good air circulation by spacing plants properly.
- Water at the base of the plant to avoid wetting leaves.
- <update>Apply a mixture of baking soda (1 tsp) and dish soap (1 tsp) in 1 liter of water once a week. This is a common organic remedy used by Sri Lankan farmers.</update>
- If infection is severe, apply a fungicide containing triadimefon or myclobutanil.
</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: Medium/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Luffa can be cultivated throughout the year in the wet zone with proper irrigation and pest management. This zone includes areas like Colombo, Galle, and Ratnapura.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Excessive heat may cause wilting. Provide shade during peak hours.
- Monitor for pests and diseases regularly.

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: High/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Luffa cultivation in the dry zone requires careful irrigation management, especially during the Yala season. This zone includes areas like Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, and Hambantota.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure proper drainage to avoid waterlogging.
- Provide shade during peak hours to prevent excessive heat stress.

### Mid country (Difficulty: Medium/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Luffa cultivation in the mid country requires careful monitoring of temperature and moisture levels. This zone includes areas like Kandy, Matale, and Badulla.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure proper drainage to avoid waterlogging.
- Provide shade during peak hours if temperatures exceed 35°C.

### Up country (Difficulty: Low/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Luffa cultivation in the upcountry is relatively easy due to cooler temperatures and adequate rainfall. This zone includes areas like Nuwara Eliya and parts of Badulla.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure proper drainage to avoid waterlogging.
- Provide additional support for vines if winds are strong.
