## Description:
Thumba Karawila is a species of flowering plant in the Cucurbitaceae/gourd family. It is widely consumed as a vegetable in Sri Lanka. Different types of plants provide differently shaped fruit: oval, cylindrical and spherical. Below are the plant varieties listed by the Department of Agriculture, Sri Lanka.

Female plant varieties – Thumbika / Golika / Wisal / Kesara / Chandu

Male plant Varieties – Parakum, wishma

Hybrid: Female -Chandu, male – Wishma

<update>Plant grows well in lowland dry zone areas of Sri Lanka, particularly in the North Central, Eastern, and Southern provinces. It is also cultivated in home gardens throughout the country.</update>

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** It is advisable to start sowing in the Maha season – September – October and in the Yala season – March – April. <update>If additional water facilities are available, it is advisable to plant in mid-December after the end of the heavy rains of the Maha season. Planting can be done at any time of the year if water is available, particularly in areas with access to irrigation systems.</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Stem cuttings with 2-4 inter-nodes are suitable for planting. When propagated by tubers, obtain tubers with a few eyes after the dormancy period of about 4 months from the previous season. Cut those tubers into about 40g pieces and plant in a sand nursery. If the seeds are sown, store the seeds obtained from the previous season under normal conditions for about 9 months and plant 4 seeds in one place and remove the other seedlings at a ratio of 6:1 – 10: 1 |

| Soil | <update>Grows well in non-loamy reddish-brown soils common in Sri Lanka's dry zone. It can also thrive in well-drained soils rich in organic matter found in other parts of the country.</update> |
| Water | <update>Provide adequate water to ensure plants do not wilt. In dry zone areas, regular irrigation is crucial, especially during prolonged dry spells.</update> |
| Light | Plentiful sunshine |

### Growing conditions:

| Temperatures | <update>27 to 32 degrees Celsius, which is typical in many parts of Sri Lanka, especially in the lowland areas</update> |

## Harvesting:
When plants are initiated with seeds flowering begins at about 3 months after seeding.

Flowers obtained 2 months after crop establishment using plant-lets obtained from stem cuttings.

A fruit yield of 6– 8 kg per year can be obtained from one female vine.

## Curing:
<update>Cure fruits by allowing them to ripen on the vine until they turn yellow. Then, store in a cool, dry place for up to two weeks. In Sri Lanka's humid climate, ensure good air circulation to prevent mold growth.</update>

## Storage
<update>Store fruits in a refrigerator at temperatures between 10-15°C (50-59°F) for up to four weeks. In areas without refrigeration, store in a cool, dry place and consume within a week.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Root rot and downy mildew can occur at any growth stage. Diseases are caused by fungi or bacteria. Insects including fruit flies, beetles, caterpillars and leaf miners may also threaten the crop.

**Symptoms:** Root rot - wilting plants, yellowing leaves, and poor fruit set. Downy mildew - yellow spots on upper surface of leaves, white patches on lower surface, and distorted leaves. Insects cause holes in leaves and fruits.

**Control method:** It is important to maintain good drainage in the field and remove diseased vines. Insect traps can be used for fruit flies. Department of Agriculture recommends applying fungicide to deal with downy mildew (thiophanate methyl 85% +, thiram 35% or Carbendazim). <update>The following steps are recommended for pests affecting all gourd varieties in Sri Lanka:</update>

* Collect infested and fallen fruits and bum in deep pits.
* Change the sowing dates as the fly population is low in hot dry conditions and at its peak during rainy season.
* Expose the pupae by ploughing and turning over soil after harvest.
* Use ribbed gourd as trap crop and apply carbaryl 0.15% or malathion 0.1% on congregating adult flies on the undersurface of leaves.
* Use attractants like citronella oil, eucalyptus oil, vinegar (acetic acid), and lactic acid to trap flies.
* Use poison baiting in severe infestation
* Mix methyl eugenol + malathion 50 EC at 1:1 ratio and keep 10 ml of the bait in polythene bags (25 per hectare).

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** Powdery mildew, Anthracnose

**Symptoms:** Powdery mildew - white patches on leaves. Anthracnose - dark spots on fruits and leaves that enlarge and turn brown or black.

**Management:**
- **Powdery mildew:** Apply sulfur or potassium bicarbonate sprays.
- **Anthracnose:** Remove infected plant material, avoid overhead irrigation, and apply copper-based fungicides.
