## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Sow seeds during September to October and March to April. If additional water is available, planting can occur in mid-December after the heavy rains. In areas with irrigation, planting can be done year-round.

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Seeds, seedlings and tubers |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Seedlings can be easily obtained using stem cuttings. Stem Cuttings with 2-4 inter-nodes are suitable for planting. When propagated by tubers, obtain tubers with a few eyes after the dormancy period of about 4 months from the previous season. Cut those tubers into about 40g pieces and plant them in a sand nursery. If the seeds are sown, store the seeds obtained from the previous season under normal conditions for about 9 months plant 4 seeds in one place, and remove the other seedlings at a ratio of 6:1 – 10: 1 |
| Soil | For optimal growth, maintain soil pH between 6.0 and 7.5. Prior to planting, loosen the soil to 20-30 cm depth and incorporate organic matter to enhance structure and nutrients. Avoid heavy clay soils, as they impede root development and nutrient absorption |
| Water | Regular irrigation is required |
| Light | Plentiful sunshine |

### Growing conditions:
| Temperatures | Lowland dry zone temperatures are suitable |
|----|----|
| Soil | Spiny gourd prefers well-drained soils such as sandy loam, loam, or well-drained clay. Good drainage prevents root rot. Enrich the soil with organic matter like well-rotted compost or aged manure to boost fertility and plant health |
| Water | Provide adequate water to ensure plants do not wilt. In dry zone areas, regular irrigation is crucial, especially during prolonged dry spells |
| Pruning | Not required |
| Weed Control | When seedlings are young, carefully uproot the weeds around them and then use a shovel to remove them without harming the base of the seedlings |

## Harvesting:
Optimal Size: Harvest the fruits when they are young and tender, typically when they reach about 2 to 3 inches in length. At this stage, they are firm but not overly mature, which ensures the best flavor and texture.

Regular Harvesting: Frequent harvesting encourages continuous fruit production. It's advisable to check the plants every few days during the growing season to collect ripe fruits.

Use of Tools: Employ a sharp knife or scissors to cut the fruits from the vine carefully. This helps prevent damage to both the fruit and the plant during the harvesting process. 

Gentle Handling: Handle the harvested spiny gourds gently, as they can be delicate and prone to bruising. Proper handling is crucial for maintaining their quality post-harvest.

## Curing:
Spiny gourd does not require a curing stage.

## Storage
After harvesting, store the spiny gourds in a cool place away from direct sunlight. For optimal taste, it's best to use them within a few days of harvest. Can also be Refrigerate for up to 2 weeks in a plastic bag in the crisper drawer.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:**
- Epilacna larvae

**Symptoms:**
- The larvae are pale yellow and covered with branched spines. The larvae and adult beetles feed on the leaf tissue.
- Infestation can stunt the growth of seedlings and mature plants.

**Control method:**
- Spray neem oil
- Introduce natural parasitoid ladybird beetles.

### Disease Control
**Disease type:**
- Root rot
- Downy mildew

**Symptoms:**
- **Root rot:** This is a disease caused by fungi or bacteria. Wilting, yellow, or sparse foliage can be seen.
- **Downy mildew:** Discoloured blotches on the upper leaf surface. These may be pale green, yellow, purple, or brown, depending on the plant affected.

**Management:**
- Maintaining good drainage in the field
- Removing diseased vines to avoid infection spreading
- If necessary apply fungicides recommended by the Department of Agriculture

### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Thumba Karawila can grow in wet zones but requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Regular monitoring of pests and diseases is necessary.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- **Root rot:** Ensure good drainage, and maintain soil health with organic matter
- **Pests and diseases:** Regular monitoring and control measures

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Thumba Karawila thrives in dry zones but requires adequate watering to prevent wilting.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- **Drought:** Provide adequate water, consider drip irrigation
- **Pests and diseases:** Regular monitoring and control measures

### Mid country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Thumba Karawila can grow in mid-country regions but requires careful management of soil moisture.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- **Soil moisture:** Ensure well-drained soil, maintain consistent watering
- **Pests and diseases:** Regular monitoring and control measures

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Thumba Karawila can grow in up-country regions but requires careful management of temperature and humidity.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- **Temperature:** Provide adequate sunlight
- **Humidity:** Maintain good air circulation to prevent fungal diseases
- **Pests and diseases:** Regular monitoring and control measures
