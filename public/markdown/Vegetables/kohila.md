## Description:
Kohila leaves and rhizomes are used as a vegetable in local Sri Lankan cuisine. It is also traditionally used as an herbal medicine for its high amount of antioxidant and dietary fiber content. There are two types of kohila.

Local kohila: The leaf is not divided into many segments. Growth is slow and yields are low. Rhizomes are relatively small and less fleshy.

Exotic Kohila: The leaf is divided into many segments. It shows higher growth rate and higher yield. Rhizomes are larger than the local variety and it is fleshy.

<update>In Sri Lanka, kohila is commonly found growing wild in marshy areas, along stream banks, and in home gardens, particularly in the wet and intermediate zones of the country.</update>

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Can be planted throughout the year <update>in Sri Lanka, but best results are achieved when planted at the beginning of the rainy season (May-June or October-November)</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Apex cuttings 20 – 25 cm (8-10 inches) in size are most commonly used for planting. Lateral shoots from kohila stems can also be used after maturation. In addition, shallow burying of stems in beds arranged in a shady place in the mud allows the shoots to emerge and more shoots are available in a short period of time ready for planting. |
|----|----|
| Planting method | **In a muddy place, destroy the weeds from time to time by ploughing the soil to a depth of 20-25 cm (8-10 inches) and drain the water in places where excess water is retained. Make beds about 5 feet wide and be sure to log them with water when needed and bury a few rows of stalks in the soil at regular intervals.** <update>In Sri Lanka, it's common to plant kohila in low-lying areas of home gardens or in dedicated paddy fields.</update> |
| Soil | Only in places where the soil is frequently waterlogged. Kohila is a suitable crop for wetlands. Therefore, it is advisable to have shade for this crop. When there is no shade, the leaves are small. <update>In Sri Lanka, kohila thrives in the clay-loam soils common in the wet zone.</update> |
| Water | Although moisture is required in the crop, prolonged exposure to water impairs growth. Therefore, necessary steps should be taken to irrigate the crop from time to time. <update>In Sri Lanka's wet zone, natural rainfall is often sufficient, but irrigation may be needed during dry spells.</update> |
| Light | Growing area must have plentiful shade. <update>In Sri Lanka, kohila is often grown under the canopy of larger trees like coconut or banana.</update> |

### Growing conditions:

| Temperatures | Grows best in temperatures between 20-30°C (68-86°F) <update>which is ideal for most parts of Sri Lanka, especially in the low and mid country regions</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | The main problem of kohila cultivation is the difficulty of weed control. After planting the shoots or buds, apply straw as a mulch to cover the ground. Weeds can also be controlled by applying mulch from time to time at different stages of the cultivation. <update>In Sri Lanka, paddy straw is commonly used as mulch.</update> |
| Water | Although moisture is required in the crop, prolonged exposure to water impairs growth. Therefore, necessary steps should be taken to irrigate the crop from time to time. <update>In Sri Lanka's wet zone, natural rainfall often provides sufficient moisture, but drainage should be managed during heavy monsoon rains.</update> |
| Pruning | Prune plants annually after harvesting to encourage new growth |
| Weed control | The main problem of kohila cultivation is the difficulty of weed control. After planting the shoots or buds, apply straw as a mulch to cover the ground. Weeds can also be controlled by applying mulch from time to time at different stages of the cultivation. <update>Manual weeding is common in Sri Lankan home gardens.</update> |

## Harvesting:
Leaves can be harvested about 8-12 months after planting. About 2,000 – 2,500kgs of rhizomes can be taken as harvest from 50 square meter area and about 150 bundles of leaves at a time. <update>In Sri Lanka, kohila is often harvested continuously from established plants in home gardens.</update>

## Curing:
After harvesting, cure kohila by washing the leaves and rhizomes thoroughly and allowing them to dry in the shade for a few days before storage. <update>In Sri Lanka, kohila is often used fresh, but any excess can be dried for later use.</update>

## Storage
Store dried kohila leaves in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Rhizomes can be stored in a humid, cool place for up to 6 months. <update>In Sri Lankan households, fresh kohila is often kept in a cool, shaded area and used within a few days.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Fusarium oxysporum (Fungus), Ralstonia solanacearum (Bacteria)
**Symptoms:** Yellowing leaves, wilting, and root rot for fungus; yellowing leaves, wilting, and black spots on leaves for bacteria
**Control method:** For fungus remove water and add 40 grams of lime per square foot. If roots are infected by bacteria, remove the infected roots and add lime after removing water. <update>In Sri Lanka, traditional remedies like neem oil or wood ash are sometimes used for pest control.</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** Anthracnose (Colletotrichum spp.)
**Symptoms:** Brown or black spots on leaves with yellow halos
**Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, remove infected leaves, and apply fungicides if necessary. <update>In Sri Lanka, copper-based fungicides are commonly used when necessary.</update>

## Difficulty Rating

### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Kohila grows well in wet conditions but requires constant shade. <update>This zone is ideal for kohila cultivation in Sri Lanka.</update>
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Requires regular weed control
- May need additional irrigation during dry periods
<update>- Manage excess water during heavy monsoon rains</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 8/10)
**Explanation:** Kohila can grow in drier conditions but requires more water management.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Requires frequent irrigation
- Needs protection from strong winds and excessive heat
<update>- May require more shade and mulching to retain moisture</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Kohila grows well in the mid-country with proper shade and moisture management.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Requires regular weed control
- May need additional irrigation during dry periods
<update>- Adapt to slightly cooler temperatures compared to low country</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 8/10)
**Explanation:** Kohila can grow in the upcountry but requires more care due to cooler temperatures.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Requires protection from frost and adequate irrigation
- Needs regular pruning to encourage new growth in cooler conditions
<update>- May require greenhouse cultivation in very high altitudes</update>
