## Description:
Corn is a tender, warm-season annual crop that produces ears of yellow, white, or bi-colored kernels. A long, frost-free growing season (60 to 100 frost-free days) is necessary to grow and harvest corn. It is a member of the grass family (*Poaceae*) and relies on wind to pollinate its flowers. This is the reason that corn is planted in blocks of short rows instead of long, single rows. There are several varieties of sweet corn.
Corn plants can grow up to 6 feet tall and have long, narrow leaves. In Sri Lanka, corn is grown in various regions and is an important crop for both human consumption and animal feed.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Can be successfully cultivated in the dry and intermediate regions of the highlands under irrigation, in the high season as well as in the early season in paddy lands without a fixed period.

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Propagate from seeds or transplant. |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Wrap the seeds in a moist cloth/paper towel for 24 hours before planting for germination. Sow seeds about 1½ to 2 inches deep and 2 to 4 inches apart in short, side-by-side rows to form a block, rather than one long row. |
| Soil | Requires deep, well-drained, humus-enriched loam. Needs a soil pH of 5.8 to 7. It requires nitrogen-rich soil as it is a heavy feeder, apply compost or manure before planting. |
| Water| Needs consistent moisture in the soil and it should be well drained. Water well at planting time, ensure soil remains moist but not waterlogged. In dry zones, consider mulching to retain moisture |
| Light| Plant in full sun (at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight), consider providing some shade during peak heat hours for better pollination |

### Growing conditions:
| Temperatures | Plant after the soil temperature reaches 15° Celsius, daytime temperatures should ideally be between 20-30°C (68-86°F). |
|----|----|
| Soil | As the roots are deep and widespread, the plant requires plenty of humus. A couple of inches (5 cm) of well-rotted manure dug well in a spit deep is ideal, consider using organic fertilizers for better growth |
| Water | Corn plants are large and fast-growing vegetables and need regular feeding and watering. Increase watering as the crop grows, and apply liquid fertilizer every 2-3 weeks during the growing season |
| Pruning | Not applicable |
| Weed control | Keep in mind that corn is shallow-rooted, so stay away from deep cultivation, and consider using mulch to suppress weeds and retain moisture. |

## Harvesting:
Test for ripeness by opening the husk and pressing your fingernail into a grain, if it is firm but
still slightly milky it is ready. Pick the corn by jerking the cob sharply downwards and breaking it off. To avoid the risk of damaging the plant, do not cut them off. 

## Curing:
Corn does not require a curing stage.

## Storage
Do not wash corn while it's still in the husk before storing. Keep the corn in its husk and refrigerate. Once you're ready to prepare it, remove the husk and silk, then rinse the corn under cool running water. Store it for up to 12 months for optimal preservation.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** 
- Earworm (_Helicoverpa zea_)

**Symptoms:**
- **Earworm:** Bore into the tips of the ears of corn.

**Control method:** 
- **Earworm:** If seen when you pick the corn, destroy them.
  
### Disease Control
**Disease type:**
- Smut (_Mycosarcoma maydis_)

**Symptoms:**
- **Smut:** A fungus that causes large gray boils to appear on the kernels.

**Control method:** 
- **Smut:** Burn affected plants and avoid leaving rotting sweet corn on the ground. Instead, bury or compost it to prevent the development of smut.


## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Corn requires consistent moisture and well-drained soil

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging, consider planting on raised beds
- Provide additional support for tall varieties, use stakes or trellises for wind protection

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** The dry zone may require more frequent watering due to higher temperatures and lower rainfall.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Water regularly, especially during flowering and ear development stages, consider using drip irrigation for efficient water use
- Consider using drought-tolerant varieties.

### Mid country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** The mid-country has varying weather conditions, requiring careful monitoring of water requirements.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Monitor soil moisture levels closely, use a soil moisture meter for accurate readings
- Adjust watering frequency based on rainfall and temperature, consider using rainwater harvesting systems

### Up country (Difficulty: 8/10)
**Explanation:** The cooler temperatures in the upcountry may affect corn growth and development, requiring careful management.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide additional warmth using row covers or plastic mulch, consider using black plastic mulch for better heat absorption
- Consider growing varieties suited to cooler climates
