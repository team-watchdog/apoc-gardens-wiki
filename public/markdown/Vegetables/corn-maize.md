## Description:
Corn is a tender, warm-season annual crop that produces ears of yellow, white, or bi-colored kernels. A long, frost-free growing season (60 to 100 frost-free days) is necessary to grow and harvest corn. It is a member of the grass family (*Poaceae*) and relies on wind to pollinate its flowers! This is the reason that corn is planted in blocks of short rows instead of long, single rows. There are several varieties of sweet corn.
<update>Corn plants can grow up to 6 feet tall and have long, narrow leaves. In Sri Lanka, corn is grown in various regions and is an important crop for both human consumption and animal feed.</update>

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>Maha season (October to January) and Yala season (April to August)</update>

### Planting conditions:

| **Propagation** | Needs 4 months to come to maturity. Propagate from seeds or transplant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Planting method | Wrap the seeds in a moist cloth/paper towel for 24 hour before planting for germination. Sow seeds about 1½ to 2 inches deep and 2 to 4 inches apart in short, side-by-side rows to form a block, rather than one long row.                                                                           |
| Soil            | Requires deep, well-drained, humus-enriched loam. Needs a soil pH of 6.5 to 7. It requires a nitrogen rich soil as it is a heavy feeder, apply compost or manure before planting<update>. In Sri Lanka, consider using locally available organic fertilizers like cow dung or poultry manure</update> |
| Water           | Needs consistent moisture in the soil and it should be well drained. Water well at planting time, ensure soil remains moist but not waterlogged. In dry zones, consider mulching to retain moisture                                                                                                   |
| Light           | Plant in full sun (at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight), consider providing some shade during peak heat hours for better pollination<update>, especially in lowland dry zones</update>                                                                                                           |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Plant after the soil temperature reaches 15° Celsius, daytime temperatures should ideally be between 20-30°C (68-86°F)<update>. In Sri Lanka, these conditions are generally met in most regions during the growing seasons</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | As the roots are deep and widespread, the plant requires plenty of humus. A couple of inches (5 cm) of well-rotted manure dug well in a spit deep is ideal, consider using organic fertilizers for better growth<update>. In Sri Lanka, incorporate locally available organic matter like rice straw or coconut husk</update> |
| Water | Corn plants are large and fast-growing vegetables and need regular feeding and watering. Increase watering as the crop grows, apply liquid fertilizer every 2-3 weeks during growing season<update>. In wet zones, ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging</update> |
| Pruning | Not applicable |
| Weed control | Keep in mind that corn is shallow-rooted, so stay away from deep cultivation, consider using mulch to suppress weeds and retain moisture<update>. Manual weeding is common in Sri Lankan small-scale farming</update> |

## Harvesting:
Pick the corn by jerking the cob sharply downwards and breaking them off. To avoid the risk of damaging the plant, do not cut them off. <update>Harvest ears when kernels are plump and milky; for best flavor, harvest early in the morning. In Sri Lanka, harvesting typically occurs 90-120 days after planting, depending on the variety</update>

## Curing:
Not applicable

## Storage
<update>Store dried corn kernels in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for up to 12 months, store at temperatures below 40°F (4°C) and humidity levels below 60% for optimal storage life. In Sri Lanka, consider using traditional storage methods like woven baskets lined with dried leaves for short-term storage</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Earthworm, Smut, <update>Fall Armyworm</update>

**Symptoms:**<update> Damage to roots and ears of corn, smut causes disfigured kernels and a powdery, black or gray mold on the plant. Fall Armyworm causes severe defoliation and damage to the developing ears</update>

**Control method:** Remove and burn the effected plant,<update> use resistant varieties, crop rotation, and avoid overhead irrigation to prevent spread. For Fall Armyworm, implement integrated pest management practices including regular scouting, use of pheromone traps, and application of biopesticides like Neem oil</update>

### Disease Control
<update>**Disease type:** Maize Streak Virus

**Symptoms:** Chlorotic streaks on leaves, stunted growth

**Control method:** Use disease-resistant varieties, control insect vectors (leafhoppers), practice crop rotation</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Corn requires consistent moisture and well-drained soil, which can be challenging in the wet zone.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging, consider planting on raised beds
- Provide additional support for tall varieties, use stakes or trellises for wind protection
<update>- Consider intercropping with legumes to improve soil fertility and reduce pest pressure</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** The dry zone may require more frequent watering due to higher temperatures and lower rainfall.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Water regularly, especially during flowering and ear development stages, consider using drip irrigation for efficient water use
- Consider using drought-tolerant varieties, such as 'Golden Bantam' or 'Honey & Cream'
<update>- Implement water conservation techniques like mulching and rainwater harvesting</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** The mid-country has varying weather conditions, requiring careful monitoring of water requirements.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Monitor soil moisture levels closely, use a soil moisture meter for accurate readings
- Adjust watering frequency based on rainfall and temperature, consider using rainwater harvesting systems
<update>- Implement terracing techniques to prevent soil erosion on sloped land</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 8/10)
**Explanation:** The cooler temperatures in the upcountry may affect corn growth and development, requiring careful management.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide additional warmth using row covers or plastic mulch, consider using black plastic mulch for better heat absorption
- Consider growing varieties suited to cooler climates, such as 'Early Sunglow' or 'Golden Cross Bantam'
<update>- Plant in protected areas to minimize exposure to strong winds common in higher elevations</update>
