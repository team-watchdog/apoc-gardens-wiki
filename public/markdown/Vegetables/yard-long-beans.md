## Description:
A variety of the cowpea, the asparagus bean is grown primarily for its strikingly long (35 to 75 centimetres (1.15 to 2.46 ft)) immature green pods and has uses very similar to those of the green bean. This plant is in a different genus from the common bean. The different colors of seeds usually distinguish the many varieties. It is a vigorous climbing annual vine. The plant is subtropical/tropical and most widely grown in the warmer parts of South Asia, Southeast Asia, and southern China. <update>In Sri Lanka, yard long beans are commonly cultivated in home gardens and commercial farms across various climatic zones.</update>

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Wet zone- after monsoonal rains; Dry Zone-Yala : in rain fed cultivations- March /April; Dry Zone – Under irrigation (Yala Season)- April/May. Maha-End of November

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Direct seeding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Planting method | Harrow soil to a depth of 15-20 cm and break the soil. If water retains in soil, or irrigation is done, prepare beds or ridges.<br>Plant 3-4 Seeds per pit after soaking them for 24 hours.<br>Irrigate the seeds well.<br>After 2 weeks of seedling emergence, Keep two healthy Seedlings and remove the rest carefully.<br>Set up about 7 ft. long poles for vine support.<br>Train the vines to poles.<br>Can place single pole per pit or set intermittent support poles and draw ropes horizontally and train the vines to the ropes. <update>In Sri Lanka, it's common to use coconut fronds or bamboo poles for support.</update> |
| Soil            | Well-draining sandy loam soil is ideal. Soil pH around 5.6 -7 is optimal. Heavy clay soils with poor drainage is not good for cultivation. <update>Soil should be well-fertilized with organic matter. In Sri Lanka, adding compost or well-rotted cow manure is recommended.</update>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Water           | At initial stages apply water every 4 days per week. Later add water once a week. If soil moisture is high, root rot disease may occur. Ensure consistent moisture but avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. In dry zones, mulching can help retain soil moisture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Light           | Requires plentiful sunlight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Can be grown in dry zone conditions. <update>The ideal temperature range for yard long beans is between 21-30°C (70-86°F), which is common in many parts of Sri Lanka. However, they can tolerate higher temperatures with proper care.</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | Well-draining sandy loam soil is ideal. Soil pH around 5.6 -7 is optimal. Heavy clay soils with poor drainage is not good for cultivation. <update>Soil should be well-fertilized with organic matter. In Sri Lanka, adding compost or well-rotted cow manure is recommended.</update> |
| Water | At initial stages apply water every 4 days per week. Later add water once a week. If soil moisture is high, root rot disease may occur <update>Ensure consistent moisture but avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. In dry zones, mulching can help retain soil moisture.</update> |
| Pruning | NA |
| Weed control | <update>Regular weeding is essential, especially in the wet zone where weed growth can be rapid. Manual weeding or mulching can be effective.</update> |

## Harvesting:
Harvest both bush & vine types every 2 days. <update>For optimal yield and continuous production, harvest regularly when pods are about 15-20 cm long. In Sri Lanka, harvesting is typically done in the early morning or late evening to avoid heat stress on the plants.</update>

## Curing:
NA

## Storage
<update>In Sri Lanka's humid climate, yard long beans are best consumed fresh. If storage is necessary, keep them in a cool, dry place or refrigerate for up to 3-4 days.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:**
**Symptoms:**
**Control method:**

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** Collar Rot/Root Rot and Ashy stem blight
**Symptoms:** 
- Root rot: Wilting, yellowing leaves, and eventual plant death.
- Ashy stem blight: Ash-colored spots on stems, which eventually turn black.
**Management:**
  - **For Root rot:**
      - Improve drainage
      - Application of fungicides to the basement
      - Crop rotation
      - Removal of infected plant parts from the field and destruction
- **For ashy stem blight:** Department of Agriculture recommends using Tebuconazole 250g /lEW fungicide after about 04 weeks of planting <update>Apply fungicide every two weeks until symptoms disappear. In organic farming, neem-based solutions can be used as an alternative.</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Yard long beans are relatively easy to grow in the wet zone, but consistent moisture management is crucial to prevent root rot.
<update>Soil preparation and pest control require some effort. The high humidity in this zone can increase the risk of fungal diseases.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Root rot can be a challenge if soil moisture is not managed properly. <update>Regularly monitor soil moisture levels and adjust watering accordingly. Raised beds can improve drainage in areas with heavy rainfall.</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Yard long beans can be grown in the dry zone with proper irrigation, but high temperatures may affect yield.
<update>Consistent water supply is essential to prevent heat stress on plants. Drip irrigation systems are recommended for efficient water use.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- High temperatures can reduce yields. <update>Provide shade during peak hours if possible and ensure consistent watering. Mulching with coconut husks or straw can help retain soil moisture.</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Yard long beans grow well in the mid country with proper soil management.
<update>Soil fertility is crucial for optimal growth. The moderate climate in this zone is generally favorable for yard long beans.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Soil fertility may decline over time. <update>Regularly apply organic matter to maintain soil fertility. Crop rotation with legumes can help improve soil health.</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Yard long beans can be grown in the up country, but frost protection may be necessary.
<update>Frost protection is crucial during cold nights. The cooler temperatures in this zone can slow growth.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Frost can damage plants. <update>Use row covers or other frost protection methods during cold periods. Choose sheltered locations for planting to minimize exposure to cold winds.</update>
