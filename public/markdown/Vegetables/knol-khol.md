## General Information
**Generic name:** Kohlrabi, German Turnip
**Sri Lankan name:** Nokol (Sinhala)
**Scientific name:** Brassica oleracea var. gongylodes
**Plant family:** Brassicaceae
**Edible parts:** Almost all parts, but the stem and leaf are preferred
**Nutrition value:** High in vitamin C, potassium, magnesium, phosphorous, calcium, iron, and folate
**Other uses:** Knol-khol is a low-calorie, low-glycemic index food; high in antioxidants, including carotenoids, and therefore considered healthy eating.
**Companion Plants:***
- Marigolds: Attract natural insect predators and help keep unwanted insects out of your growing space.
- Cabbage: Can be intercropped with kohlrabi, suggesting they are compatible companions.
- Curry Chili: Another intercropping option mentioned, indicating it's a suitable companion for kohlrabi.
- Onions: May help repel pests that affect Brassicaceae family members.
- Herbs (e.g., dill, cilantro): Attract beneficial insects that can help control pests like aphids.
- Legumes (e.g., beans, peas): Can fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting kohlrabi's growth.

**Non-Companion Plants:**
- Other Brassicaceae family members (e.g., broccoli, cauliflower): Should not be planted in rotation with kohlrabi to prevent disease buildup, especially clubroot.
- Strawberries: May compete for nutrients and are susceptible to some of the same pests.
- Tomatoes: Require different soil conditions and may compete for nutrients.
- Eggplants: Belong to the nightshade family and have different growing requirements.
- Sunflowers: Their height can overshadow kohlrabi and potentially stunt its growth.

## Description:
Kohlrabi has been created by artificial selection for lateral meristem growth (a swollen, nearly spherical shape); its origin in nature is the same as that of cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, collard greens, and Brussels sprouts: they are all bred from, and are the same species as, the wild cabbage plant (Brassica oleracea).

The taste and texture of kohlrabi are similar to those of a broccoli stem or cabbage heart, but milder and sweeter, with a higher ratio of flesh to skin. They can be eaten in a variety of ways - raw in salads, roasted, added to soups and stews, pureed, boiled, or mashed with potatoes. 

### Planting conditions:

| **Propagation** | Direct seed or create transplants indoors |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Planting method | Prepare beds and plant seeds from mid-August until September, at one inch spacing, and one-fourth to one-half inch deep. Maintain a 30 cm distance between each column. Planting after October in the mid and low country could lead to reduced yields due to high temperatures. |
| Soil            | Soil should have plenty of organic matter and mulch to trap moisture. Recommended pH level is 5.5 |
| Water           | In the absence of rain apply one to one and a half inches of water per week. |
| Light           | 6 hours of sunlight per day |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Optimal temperature range: 15-25Â°C |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Soil | If humidity is low, help to keep the soil moist by spreading a thin layer of mulch around the base of the plant. Weed diligently but take care to not disturb the roots |
| Water | Water 1 inch per square foot per week, unless the soil seems to be drying out sooner. |
| Pruning | Prune plants if they become too leggy or if you want to encourage bushier growth. |
| Weed control | Hand-pull weeds regularly, and consider using organic herbicides like vinegar if the infestation is large. |

## Harvesting:
Expect to harvest crop within 50-60 days of planting.

## Curing:
Cure kohlrabi by storing them in a cool, humid place for about two weeks after harvesting. This helps to toughen the skin and improve storage life.

## Storage
Store cured kohlrabi in the refrigerator for up to 3 months.

## Protecting your plants

### Pest control
**Pest type:** Plants are susceptible to the same pests and diseases that other Brassicaceae family members are afflicted by. This includes cutworms, cabbage worms, flea beetles, aphids, damping off, root rot, and snails and slugs.

**Symptoms:** Holes in leaves, wilting plants, sticky honeydew on leaves

**Control method:** Ensure that soil is not waterlogged, and rotate the plants with non-Brassicaceae plants. Keeping beds neat and tidy will help prevent these problems. You can also sow plants, such as marigolds, to attract natural insect predators and keep unwanted insects out of your growing space. Use neem oil or pyrethrum-based organic pesticides for severe infestations. Introduce beneficial insects like ladybugs to control aphids.

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** Clubroot, Blackleg, Powdery mildew, Downy mildew

**Symptoms:** 
- Clubroot: Swelling or malformation on the main lateral roots, appearing like clubs or spindles
- Powdery mildew: Small white patches on upper and lower leaf surfaces, which may show purple blotching; later, a powdery layer coats the leaves
- Downy mildew: Irregular yellow patches on leaves that later turn brown; white fluffy growth on the undersides of leaves in favorable conditions

**Management:** 
- Rotate crops with non-Brassicaceae plants
- Maintain good soil drainage and avoid overhead watering
- Use disease-resistant varieties when available
- Apply lime to increase soil pH if clubroot is a persistent problem
- For clubroot: Keep soil pH slightly basic (7.1-7.2) by adding agricultural lime (2-4 t/ha)
- For powdery mildew: Remove crop debris after harvest, control weeds, apply surface sprays, dusts, or vapors
- For downy mildew: Cover nursery to protect from rain, allow sunlight in the morning, apply fungicide containing tebuconazole (5 ml for 10 liters of water) once if necessary
