## Description:
Kohlrabi has been created by artificial selection for lateral meristem growth (a swollen, nearly spherical shape); its origin in nature is the same as that of cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, collard greens, and Brussels sprouts: they are all bred from, and are the same species as, the wild cabbage plant (Brassica oleracea).

The taste and texture of kohlrabi are similar to those of a broccoli stem or cabbage heart, but milder and sweeter, with a higher ratio of flesh to skin.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** The crop grows well in Nuwara Eliya and Badulla districts belonging to the upland wet zone and the intermediate zone. Cultivation is done in the high (Maha) season in the mid country and low country areas.

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Direct seed or create transplants indoors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Planting method | Prepare beds and plant seeds from mid-August until September, at one inch spacing, and one-fourth to one-half inch deep. Maintain a 30 cm distance between each column. Planting after October in the mid and low country could lead to reduced yields due to high temperatures. |
| Soil            | Soil should have plenty of organic matter and mulch to trap moisture. Recommended pH level is 5.5                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Water           | In the absence of rain apply one to one and a half inches of water per week.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Light           | 6 hours of sunlight per day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | <update>Optimal temperature range: 15-25Â°C</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | If humidity is low, help to keep the soil moist by spreading a thin layer of mulch around the base of the plant. Weed diligently but take care to not disturb the roots |
| Water | Water 1 inch per square foot per week, unless the soil seems to be drying out sooner. |
| Pruning | Prune plants if they become too leggy or if you want to encourage bushier growth. |
| Weed control | Hand-pull weeds regularly, and consider using organic herbicides like vinegar if the infestation is large. |

## Harvesting:
Expect to harvest crop within 45-60 days of planting.

## Curing:
<update>Cure kohlrabi by storing them in a cool, humid place for about two weeks after harvesting. This helps to toughen the skin and improve storage life.</update>

## Storage
<update>Store cured kohlrabi in the refrigerator for up to 3 months.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Plants are susceptible to the same pests and diseases that other Brassicaceae family members are afflicted by. This includes cutworms, cabbage worms, flea beetles, aphids, damping off, root rot, and snails and slugs.

**Symptoms:** <update>Holes in leaves, wilting plants, sticky honeydew on leaves</update>

**Control method:** Ensure that soil is not waterlogged, and rotate the plants with non- Brassicaceae plants. Keeping beds neat and tidy will help prevent these problems. You can also sow plants, such as marigolds, to attract natural insect predators and keep unwanted insects out of your growing space. <update>Use neem oil or pyrethrum-based organic pesticides for severe infestations. Introduce beneficial insects like ladybugs to control aphids.</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** <update>Clubroot, Blackleg</update>

**Symptoms:** <update>Yellowing leaves, wilting, swollen roots</update>

**Management:** <update>Rotate crops with non-Brassicaceae plants, maintain good soil drainage, and avoid overhead watering. Use disease-resistant varieties when available. Apply lime to increase soil pH if clubroot is a persistent problem.</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Kohlrabi can be challenging to grow in the low country wet zone due to high temperatures. The hot and humid climate can cause bolting and affect the quality of the crop.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- High temperatures can cause bolting. Adaptation: Provide shade during peak hours using row covers or other methods.
- <update>High humidity can increase disease pressure. Adaptation: Ensure good air circulation and use fungicides if necessary.</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** The low country dry zone has suitable temperatures for kohlrabi growth, but water stress can be an issue due to limited rainfall.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Water stress. Adaptation: Mulch and provide adequate irrigation using drip systems or other efficient methods.
- <update>Pest pressure may be higher. Adaptation: Implement integrated pest management strategies.</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** The mid country has suitable temperatures and rainfall for kohlrabi cultivation, making it relatively easy to grow.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Minimal challenges, but regular weeding is required. Adaptation: Maintain good weed control practices.
- <update>Occasional frost in higher elevations. Adaptation: Use row covers or plant in protected areas.</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** The up country's cooler climate can slow down kohlrabi growth and may require additional care to ensure optimal growth.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Cooler temperatures can slow growth. Adaptation: Provide additional warmth using row covers, black plastic mulch, or other methods to help maintain suitable growing conditions.
- Frost protection might be necessary during colder nights.
- <update>Higher rainfall might increase disease risk. Adaptation: Ensure good drainage and use raised beds if necessary.</update>
