## General Information
**Generic name:** Drumstick Tree, Horseradish tree
**Sri Lankan name:** Murunga (Sinhala), Mōriṅkā (Tamil)
**Scientific name:** *Moringa Oleifera*
**Plant family:** Moringaceae
**Edible parts:** Leaves and the pods
**Nutrition value:** High in vitamins A, C, and minerals like calcium and iron. The leaves are highly nutritious.
**Companion plants:**
>Companion plants aid growth by attracting beneficial insects, repelling pests, and providing support. They are part of a natural pest control system, maximising space and increasing crop productivity.

- Cowpea
- Okra
- Tomato
**Non-companion plants:** <update>Peppermint</update>

## Description:
It is a small tree up to 9-12 m high with a truck of 60 cm across. It has feather like divided leaves that has a pale colour and a grey, thick bark. The bark is corky and peels off in patches. The flowers are pale yellow and contain both sexes. The seed capsules are up to 45 cm long. They are roughly triangular in shape and split open when dry. Pruning is necessary to maintain the tree at the size you want it to be. There are two drumstick varieties; annual and perennial.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>Year-round, but best during the rainy season (October - December in the wet zone, April - May in the dry zone)</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Cuttings (perennial variety) or seeds (annual variety) |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Dig pits of size 45 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm with a spacing of 2.0 - 2.5 m either way. Apply compost after mixing with top soil. |
| Soil | A soil with a pH balance of 6-7.5 is suitable. It grows well in a wide range of soil but a deep sandy loamy soil is ideal for cultivating the crop. |
| Water | Keep the soil consistently moist, but not wet. Established plants are drought-tolerant, but young plants need consistent moisture to encourage strong growth. They cannot tolerate frost or water-logging. |
| Light | Needs a bright, sunny location that receives direct sunlight throughout the day. Growth may be stunted if the plants do not receive enough light. |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | <update>Thrives in temperatures between 25-35°C, common in most parts of Sri Lanka</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | Moringa trees are adaptable to a wide range of soils and can survive in poor soils if needed. However, they thrive in well-draining, sandy soils. As the plant is sensitive to root rot, they will not thrive in overly compacted soil or soil that holds too much moisture. Add compost or cow manure to soil when planting to provide needed nutrients. |
| Water | Infrequent, deep watering is better than frequent, light watering. Saplings will need more water than established trees. Keep the soil moist around them by watering every 2-3 days. |
| Pruning | Regular pruning of damaged portions helps maintain tree size and encourages bushier growth. |
| Weed control | <update>Hand-pulling or hoeing</update> |

## Harvesting:
Moringa pods can be harvested for fresh eating when they're about six inches in length. At this young, undeveloped size, the entire pod is edible as are the immature seeds within. These are often cooked like string beans. Mature pods can be harvested at full size. Leaves can be also extracted in abundance and can be cooked, made into salads and made into dried powder.

## Curing: <update>Sun-drying</update>

## Storage: <update>Airtight container in a cool, dry place</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** <update>Fruit flies, aphids, leaf-eating caterpillars, mealy bugs</update>

**Symptoms:** Damage to leaves and pods, holes in leaves, wilting of plant parts.

**Control method:** Regular pruning of damaged portions, spraying neem oil, and keeping the area around the tree debris free. <update>Use of sticky traps for fruit flies.</update>

### Disease Control
<update>
**Disease type:** Powdery mildew, root rot

**Symptoms:** White spots on leaves that eventually cover the entire leaf surface. Yellowing leaves and wilting for root rot.

**Management:** Avoid overhead watering, provide good air circulation, and apply fungicides if necessary. For root rot, improve soil drainage and reduce watering frequency.

## Difficulty Rating

### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Moringa trees grow well in the warm, humid conditions of the wet zone.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure proper drainage to prevent root rot.
- Provide consistent moisture, especially for young plants.
<update>- Monitor for fungal diseases due to high humidity.</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Moringa trees are well-suited to the dry zone's climate, being drought-tolerant once established.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Water regularly during the dry season to maintain tree health.
- Protect from strong winds, as they can damage the tree.
<update>- Mulch around the base to retain soil moisture.</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Moringa trees grow well in a variety of conditions but prefer warm temperatures and consistent moisture.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure proper drainage to prevent root rot.
- Provide consistent moisture, especially during dry periods.
<update>- May need protection from heavy rains during monsoon seasons.</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Moringa trees can grow in cooler temperatures of the up country, but growth may be slower.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide protection from strong winds and heavy rains.
- Ensure proper drainage to prevent root rot.
<update>- Choose sheltered locations with good sun exposure.</update>
