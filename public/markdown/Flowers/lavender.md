## Description:
Lavender is a flowering, drought-tolerant perennial shrub in the mint family, easily identified by its sweet floral scent. It is believed to be native to the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and India, with a history dating as far back as 2,500 years. While not native to Sri Lanka, it has been introduced and can be cultivated in certain regions of the country, primarily grown for its ornamental value and essential oil production.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Late October to early December

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Seeds or cuttings |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Germinate in moist soil or paper towels. Seeds should germinate in around 14-21 days. Once the seedlings germinate transplant them in a favorable location to the beds at 40-80 cm apart |
| Soil | Requires well drained, neutral soil (pH 5.5-8). If necessary, mix local soil with sand and compost to improve drainage.  |
| Water | Young plants should be watered frequently |
| Light | Needs full sunshine at least 6 hours a day |

### Growing conditions:
| Temperatures | Prefers average temperature of between 20-30Â°C |
|----|----|
| Soil | Lavender can grow in nutrient-poor soils. Improve soil by adding organic compost or manure before planting |
| Water | Young plants should be watered frequently, letting the soil dry in between (mature plants are drought tolerant and cannot stand overwatering) |
| Pruning | Prune plants in early spring to encourage bushy growth |
| Weed control | Keep the area around lavender plants weed-free |

## Harvesting:
Lavender is a slow growing plant and will typically take until the next planting season to flower. Harvest flowering stems when buds first open.

## Curing:
Cut flowers on a dry day, tie them into small bunches, and hang upside down in a well-ventilated area to dry. In Sri Lanka's humid climate, ensure proper air circulation to prevent mold.

## Storage
Store dried lavender in an airtight container away from light and heat for up to 1 year. In Sri Lanka's humid environment, consider adding silica gel packets to prevent moisture absorption.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:**
- Spider Mites
- Scale Insects
- Aphids
- Mealybugs
- Fungus Gnats

**Symptoms:**
- **Spider Mites:** Fine webbing on leaves, yellow speckling, and leaf drop.
- **Scale Insects:** Sticky residue on leaves, deformed foliage, and visible bumps on stems.
- **Aphids:** Curling leaves, sticky honeydew residue, and the presence of ants attracted to the honeydew.
- **Mealybugs:** White, cottony clusters on stems and leaves.
- **Fungus Gnats:** Adult flies visible around the soil; larvae can damage roots.

**Control method:**
- **Spider Mites:** Use soapy water sprays, introduce predatory mites, or apply miticides like abamectin for severe infestations.
- **Scale Insects:** Remove by hand with rubbing alcohol on cotton swabs or use horticultural oil to smother larger infestations.
- **Aphids:** Introduce beneficial insects like ladybugs or use insecticidal soap to manage populations.
- **Mealybugs:** Hand removal with alcohol-soaked cotton swabs or application of insecticidal soap.
- **Fungus Gnats:** Allow soil to dry out between waterings and use yellow sticky traps to catch adults.

### Disease Control
**Disease type:**
- Root Rot
- Alfalfa Mosaic Virus
- Septoria Leaf Spot
- Lavender Shab

**Symptoms:**
- **Root Rot:** Wilting leaves, yellowing foliage, and discolored root tissue.
- **Alfalfa Mosaic Virus:** Yellow patches on leaves that curl and distort.
- **Septoria Leaf Spot:** Tiny grey spots on leaves that expand, leading to leaf death.
- **Lavender Shab:** Brown stems with black spots; sudden wilting of shoots.

**Management:**
- **Root Rot:** Improve soil drainage and avoid overwatering; remove infected plants to prevent spread.
- **Alfalfa Mosaic Virus:** Uproot and dispose of infected plants immediately; sanitize tools to prevent spread.
- **Septoria Leaf Spot:** Keep foliage dry by ensuring good air circulation; remove infected leaves and apply organic fungicides like neem oil.
- **Lavender Shab:** There is no cure; remove and destroy infected plants while wearing gloves to prevent contamination.

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Lavender prefers well-drained soil and full sun. Wet zone conditions may require additional care to prevent root rot.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Use raised beds or containers with a well-draining potting mix
- Provide adequate sunlight, even if artificial lighting is needed

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Lavender tolerates drought conditions once established. Dry zone conditions are suitable for lavender growth.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Water plants regularly during the first year to encourage root development
- Provide afternoon shade to protect from intense heat

### Mid country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Mid country temperatures can be suitable for lavender, but proper drainage is crucial.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure well-drained soil by adding organic matter or raising planting beds
- Monitor humidity levels and provide good air circulation

### Up country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Up country conditions in Sri Lanka, particularly in areas like Nuwara Eliya, can be ideal for lavender cultivation due to cooler temperatures. However, constant humidty may be detrimental for mature plants.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Consider greenhouse cultivation for year-round production
