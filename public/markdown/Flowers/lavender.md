### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Seeds or cuttings |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Prepare garden beds by 10–20cm and add some course sand to ensure easy drainage. Once the seedlings germinate in two to three weeks; transplant them in a favorable location |
| Soil | Requires well drained, neutral soil (pH 5.5-8). <update>In Sri Lanka, mix local soil with sand and compost to improve drainage.</update> |
| Water | <update>Water sparingly, as Sri Lankan humidity can lead to root rot. Allow soil to dry between waterings.</update> |
| Light | Needs full sunshine at least 6 hours a day |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | <update>Prefers average temperature of between 20-30°C, which can be found in Sri Lankan hill country</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | Improve soil by adding organic compost or manure before planting |
| Water | Apply appropriate watering, especially during dry seasons |
| Pruning | Prune plants in early spring to encourage bushy growth |
| Weed control | Keep the area around lavender plants weed-free |

## Harvesting:
Harvest flowering stems when first buds open during the first growing season. <update>In Sri Lanka, this typically occurs during the dry season (January to March).</update>

## Curing:
Cut flowers on a dry day, tie them into small bunches, and hang upside down in a well-ventilated area to dry. <update>In Sri Lanka's humid climate, ensure proper air circulation to prevent mold.</update>

## Storage
Store dried lavender in an airtight container away from light and heat for up to 1 year. <update>In Sri Lanka's humid environment, consider adding silica gel packets to prevent moisture absorption.</update>

## Protecting your plants
