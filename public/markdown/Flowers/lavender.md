## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>Late October to early December (after the monsoon)</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Seeds or cuttings |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Prepare garden beds by 10–20cm and add some course sand to ensure easy drainage. Once the seedlings germinate in two to three weeks; transplant them in a favorable location |
| Soil | Requires well drained, neutral soil (pH 5.5-8). <update>In Sri Lanka, mix local soil with sand and compost to improve drainage.</update> |
| Water | <update>Water sparingly, as Sri Lankan humidity can lead to root rot. Allow soil to dry between waterings.</update> |
| Light | Needs full sunshine at least 6 hours a day |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | <update>Prefers average temperature of between 20-30°C, which can be found in Sri Lankan hill country</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | Improve soil by adding organic compost or manure before planting |
| Water | Apply appropriate watering, especially during dry seasons |
| Pruning | Prune plants in early spring to encourage bushy growth |
| Weed control | Keep the area around lavender plants weed-free |

## Harvesting:
Harvest flowering stems when first buds open during the first growing season. <update>In Sri Lanka, this typically occurs during the dry season (January to March).</update>

## Curing:
<update>Cut flowers on a dry day, tie them into small bunches, and hang upside down in a well-ventilated area to dry. In Sri Lanka's humid climate, ensure proper air circulation to prevent mold.</update>

## Storage
<update>Store dried lavender in an airtight container away from light and heat for up to 1 year. In Sri Lanka's humid environment, consider adding silica gel packets to prevent moisture absorption.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Spittle Bugs, Whiteflies, Aphids <update>Mealybugs, Spider mites, Thrips</update>

**Symptoms:** Wilting leaves, yellowing leaves, sticky honeydew on leaves

**Control method:**
- Wash plants periodically with a strong spray of water
- Encourage a predatory lady bird beetle that feeds on all stages of whiteflies
- <update>Use neem oil sprays, which are readily available in Sri Lanka</update>
- Remove affected plants

### Disease Control
<update>
**Disease type:** Root rot, <update>Fungal diseases</update>

**Symptoms:** Wilting leaves, yellowing leaves, and a foul odor from the soil around the plant

**Management:**
- Avoid overwatering; ensure proper drainage by adding sand or gravel to planting beds
- <update>In Sri Lanka's humid climate, consider raised beds or container planting to improve drainage</update>
- Remove affected plants promptly

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 8/10)
**Explanation:** Lavender prefers well-drained soil and full sun. Wet zone conditions may require additional care to prevent root rot.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Use raised beds or containers with a well-draining potting mix</update>
- Provide adequate sunlight, even if artificial lighting is needed

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Lavender tolerates drought conditions once established. Dry zone conditions are suitable for lavender growth.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Water plants regularly during the first year to encourage root development
- <update>Provide afternoon shade to protect from intense heat</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Mid country temperatures can be suitable for lavender, but proper drainage is crucial.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure well-drained soil by adding organic matter or raising planting beds
- <update>Monitor humidity levels and provide good air circulation</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Up country conditions in Sri Lanka, particularly in areas like Nuwara Eliya, can be ideal for lavender cultivation due to cooler temperatures and lower humidity.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Protect plants from heavy rainfall during monsoon season</update>
