**Plant family:** Lamiaceae (Mint family)
**Edible parts:** N/A
**Companion plants:**
## Companion Plants:**

Lavender is a great companion plant that repels bugs such as mosquitos, fleas, moths, and ticks while attracting pollinators like bees. As such, lavender can benefit a wide variety of plants in any herb garden, including but not limited to: 

- Thyme: Acts as a great ground cover around lavender and has similar low-maintenance needs.
- Sage: Shares similar water needs and strong scents with lavender, creating an appealing texture and color contrast.
- Rosemary: Has similar growing needs and appearance to lavender, and both help deter pests in vegetable gardens.
- Oregano: Repels aphids and small flies that could potentially damage lavender plants.
- Yarrow: Attracts pollinators and thrives in similar full-sun, drought-tolerant conditions as lavender.
- Strawberries: Benefits from lavender's ability to repel slugs, rabbits, and deer.
- Bell Peppers: Lavender attracts pollinators that can improve pepper fruit set and size.
- Jasmine: Complements lavender's scent and benefits from its pest-repelling properties.
- Alliums (garlic, onions, etc): Benefits from lavender warding off pests

## Description:
Lavender is a flowering, drought-tolerant perennial shrub in the mint family, easily identified by its sweet floral scent. It is believed to be native to the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and India, with a history dating as far back as 2,500 years. While not native to Sri Lanka, it has been introduced and can be cultivated in certain regions of the country, primarily grown for its ornamental value and essential oil production.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Late October to early December (after the monsoon)

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Seeds or cuttings |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Germinate in moist soil or paper towels. Seeds should germinate in around 14-21 days. Once the seedlings germinate in 1-2 months, transplant them in a favorable location to the beds at 4-80 cm apart |
| Soil | Requires well drained, neutral soil (pH 5.5-8). If necessary, mix local soil with sand and compost to improve drainage.  |
| Water | Young plants should be watered frequently (mature plants are drought tolerant and don't like too much  water)|
| Light | Needs full sunshine at least 6 hours a day |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Prefers average temperature of between 20-30Â°C |
|----|----|
| Soil | Lavender can grow in nutrient-poor soils. Improve soil by adding organic compost or manure before planting |
| Water | Young plants should be watered frequently, letting the soil dry in between (mature plants are drought tolerant and cannot stand overwatering) |
| Pruning | Prune plants in early spring to encourage bushy growth |
| Weed control | Keep the area around lavender plants weed-free |




## Harvesting:
Lavender is a slow growing plant and will typically take until the next planting season to flower. Harvest flowering stems when first buds open.

## Curing:
Cut flowers on a dry day, tie them into small bunches, and hang upside down in a well-ventilated area to dry. In Sri Lanka's humid climate, ensure proper air circulation to prevent mold.

## Storage
Store dried lavender in an airtight container away from light and heat for up to 1 year. In Sri Lanka's humid environment, consider adding silica gel packets to prevent moisture absorption.

### Pest Control

**Pest types:** 
- Aphids (greenflies or blackflies)
- Whiteflies
- Spider mites
- Slugs and snails

**Symptoms:**
- Aphids and Whiteflies: Leaf curling, yellowing, stunted growth, sticky honeydew on leaves
- Spider Mites: Fine silvery webbing on leaves and flowers, leaf damage, discoloration
- Slugs and Snails: Irregular holes in leaves, stems, and flowers

**Prevention and Control Methods:**
1. Encourage natural predators (ladybirds, lacewings, hoverflies) by planting companion plants like marigolds, cosmos, and zinnias.
2. Regularly inspect plants and remove infected leaves or stems.
3. Maintain adequate watering and humidity levels to deter spider mites.
4. Use copper barriers, diatomaceous earth, crushed eggshells, or sharp sand to deter slugs and snails.
5. Wash plants periodically with a strong spray of water to dislodge pests.
6. Apply insecticidal soap or neem oil for soft-bodied pests.
7. Introduce beneficial insects like ladybugs and predatory mites.
8. Use Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) to control caterpillars if necessary.
9. Remove severely affected plants to prevent spread.

### Disease Control

**Disease types:** 
- Root rot 
- Fungal diseases (e.g., Fusarium and Phytophthora)

**Symptoms:** 
- Wilting leaves
- Yellowing leaves
- Foul odor from the soil around the plant

**Prevention and Control Methods:**
1. Plant lavender in well-draining soil; add sand or grit to improve drainage.
2. Water sparingly, especially during wet periods.
3. Ensure proper spacing between plants for adequate airflow.
4. Remove affected plants promptly to prevent spread.
5. Apply neem oil, which has antifungal properties, for mild fungal infections.
6. Use organic fungicides if necessary, following local regulations.




## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Lavender prefers well-drained soil and full sun. Wet zone conditions may require additional care to prevent root rot.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Use raised beds or containers with a well-draining potting mix
- Provide adequate sunlight, even if artificial lighting is needed

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Lavender tolerates drought conditions once established. Dry zone conditions are suitable for lavender growth.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Water plants regularly during the first year to encourage root development
- Provide afternoon shade to protect from intense heat

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Mid country temperatures can be suitable for lavender, but proper drainage is crucial.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure well-drained soil by adding organic matter or raising planting beds
- Monitor humidity levels and provide good air circulation

### Up country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Up country conditions in Sri Lanka, particularly in areas like Nuwara Eliya, can be ideal for lavender cultivation due to cooler temperatures and lower humidity.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Consider greenhouse cultivation for year-round production
