## Description:
Shoe flowers are fast-growing shrubs that can reach up to 2 meters in height. They have bright red flowers and serrated green leaves. The plant is known for its various medicinal uses. The flowers are used to make tea that helps with painful periods, urinary issues, fevers, coughs, and hair growth.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Year-round in Sri Lanka

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Seeds |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Plant the seeds in soil that stays moist and don't let the soil dry. Plant the soil in a depth of 0.5-1cm (0.25-0.5 inch) but cover lightly and don't push |
| Soil | Grows in a variety of soil but requires well-drained soil. Needs a pH balance of 6.0-7.0 |
| Water | Keep soil moist but not wet. Requires regular watering during dry seasons in Sri Lanka|
| Light | Requires full sunshine but also grows in light shade with fewer and likely smaller flowers |

### Growing conditions:

| Temperatures | Grows well in Sri Lankan temperatures ranging from 20-35°C. Might die off at temperatures below 2°C |
|----|----|
| Soil | Hibiscus is carefree but does require some fertilizer. Mix the soil with compost, humus, or organic matter and mulch to cover the soil to keep it moist and weed free |
| Water | Requires moderate levels of water. Increase watering during dry seasons |
| Pruning | Require little pruning during the growing season unless space is an issue. Prune in the early dry season to encourage bushy growth |
| Weed control | Mulch around the base of plants to suppress weeds and retain moisture.

## Harvesting:
Harvesting young full-grown leaves cut next to the stems or with all the stems.

## Curing: 
Hang the flowers upside down in a well-ventilated area until completely dry.

## Storage: 
Store dried flowers in an airtight container away from light and heat. Leaves can be frozen for later use.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** 
- Aphids
- Thrips

**Symptoms:** 
- **Aphids:** Soft-bodied insects with piercing-sucking mouthparts feed on plant sap, often forming colonies on the undersides of young leaves in spring. When plants are heavily infested, the leaves may wilt, turn yellow, and fall off early due to the loss of sap.
  
- **Thrips:** Insects that feed by puncturing the outer skin of the leaf and sucking out the fleshy leaf tissue. Their feeding causes off-colored foliage and stunted growth.

**Control method:** 
- Spray neem oil
- Introduce ladybugs as natural predators

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** 
- Powdery Mildew
- Downy Mildew

**Symptoms:** 
- **Powdery Mildew:** Powdery mildew starts as white spots on leaves, eventually turning gray or tan as the fungus spreads. It stunts plant growth, and in severe cases, the leaves may wither and drop off.
  
- **Downy Mildew:** These conditions cause yellow spots to appear on the upper leaf surface, usually between the veins. As the spots spread, they avoid the veins and eventually turn brown.

**Management:** 
- Avoid overwatering
- Ensure good drainage
- Remove infected parts

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Thrives in warm, humid conditions but requires attention to prevent fungal diseases

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure good drainage and air circulation to prevent fungal issues
- Use raised beds or mounds in areas prone to waterlogging

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Requires regular watering during prolonged dry periods but generally well-suited to the climate

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Implement drip irrigation or water-conserving techniques
- Use heavy mulching to retain soil moisture

### Mid country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Ideal growing conditions with moderate temperatures and rainfall

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Monitor for pests during rainy seasons
- Provide partial shade during exceptionally hot periods

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Can be grown but may require protection from cooler temperatures and strong winds

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Use protective structures or grow near buildings for warmth
- Choose sheltered locations to protect from strong winds
