## General Information
**Generic name:** Jasmine
**Sri Lankan name:** Pichcha, Samanpichcha (Sinhala) | Malligai (Tamil)
**Scientific name:** Jasminum officinale
**Plant family:** Oleaceae
**Edible parts:** N/A
**Companion plants:**

Jasmine is a low-maintenance plant that grows vigorously and pairs well with trees.
- Bananas and citrus trees provide shade and mulch
- Bamboo provides shade and attracts insects such as ladybugs, which feed on aphids that can attack jasmine
- Rosemary and alliums (onions, garlic) can provide pest protection

**Non-companion plants:** 
- Plants of the nightshade tree (tomatoes, eggplants, and peppers) are susceptible to the same diseases that can attack jasmine; the plants themselves can stunt the growth of jasmine
- Jasmine will compete with mint for resources

## Description:
Jasmine, (genus Jasminum), genus of about 200 species of fragrant-flowered shrubs and vines of the olive family (Oleaceae). The plants are native to tropical and to some temperate areas. Most true jasmines have climbing branches without tendrils. The white, yellow, or rarely pink flowers are tubular with a flaring, lobed, pinwheel-like form; some double-flowered varieties have been developed. They are also occasionally used in teas.

In Sri Lanka, crepe jasmine (Samanpichcha, aka Tabernaemontana divaricata, aka the pinwheel flower) shrubs grow almost everywhere, usually cultivated in small gardens or left to grow by the wayside. Its flowers are widely used in religious ceremonies. Unlike other jasmines, crepe jasmine has little to no fragrance. Other varieties exist, such as wal pichcha (a vine that bears flowers similar to crepe jasmine) and etteriya aka orange jasmine, which grows into a short tree.

## Planting requirements
Almost all jasmines do well in tropical conditions and are hardy growers that need little maintenance except pruning. For most jasmines, it's best to provide a support structure (either a trellis or wall) that the vine can climb across. You can also grow jasmine in large pots.

**Planting season:** Year-round in most parts of Sri Lanka, but best planted at the beginning of the rainy season (May-June or October-November)

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Propagated through cuttings, layering, suckers, grafting, budding, tissue culture |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Plough the soil and bring the soil to a proper tilt stage and then dig pits the size of 30cmX30cmX30cm. It's best to expose these pits for 2-3 weeks beforehand for sunlight to eliminate soil borne diseases and mites |
| Soil | Grows in a variety of soils. However, grows well in well drained loamy soil that is rich in organic matter with a pH between 6.5 and 7.5 |
| Water | Timely watering is important for good growth and production of flowers |
| Light | Requires 6 hours of direct sunlight |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Needs a soil temperature between 15째 to 24째                                                                                                             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Soil             | Keep the soil weed free. If possible, add mulch to prevent weed, soil erosion and retain water moisture                                          |
| Water            | Drip irrigation is preferred. First irrigate the plant immediately after planting. Otherwise 4-5 days of irrigation depending on climate and soil type |
| Pruning          | Prune to control growth or to encourage more flowers                                                                       |
| Weed control     | Handpick weeds regularly, especially during the first year                                                                                              |

## Harvesting:
Jasmine starts flowering after 6 months of planting and can be harvested throughout the year. 

## Storage: 
Fully developed flower buds should be handpicked in the early morning and late evening and can last for up to two weeks if kept in a cool place.

## Protecting your plants
Jasmines are generally resistant to pests and diseases. 

## Difficulty Rating

Jasmine is generally easy to grow in Sri Lanka's climate, with the plant being particularly well-suited to the mid-country and low country wet zone. The main considerations are ensuring proper drainage in wetter areas and adequate water in drier zones. The up-country presents the most challenges due to potentially cooler temperatures, but even there, jasmine can be grown with some adaptations.

# Jasmine Growing Difficulty in Sri Lanka

## Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 3/10)

**Explanation:** Jasmine thrives in tropical conditions and is well-suited to the wet zone.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot in high rainfall areas
- Use raised beds or mounds to improve soil drainage if needed
- Prune regularly to control growth and improve air circulation

## Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 4/10)

**Explanation:** Jasmine adapts well to various conditions but may need extra care in drier areas.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Use mulch to retain soil moisture
- Implement drip irrigation for efficient water use
- Provide partial shade during extreme heat if necessary

## Mid country (Difficulty: 2/10)

**Explanation:** The mid-country's climate is likely ideal for jasmine cultivation.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Maintain consistent watering schedule
- Prune as needed to control growth and encourage flowering
- Monitor for any signs of stress, though these are unlikely

## Up country (Difficulty: 5/10)

**Explanation:** While jasmine can grow in cooler areas, it may require some extra care in the up-country.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Choose planting locations with maximum sun exposure (6 hours daily)
- Consider using greenhouses or protected areas for optimal growth
- Ensure soil temperature stays between 15째 to 24째 C for best results
