## Description:
Marigolds are cheerful, brilliantly coloured annuals that are long-standing favourite summer flowers for borders and pots. Colours are mainly yellow and orange with some reds and creamy white. All marigolds are excellent for attracting pollinating insects and are enormously useful as companion plants. In Sri Lanka, they are commonly used in religious ceremonies and as natural pest repellents in home gardens. French marigolds (Tagetes patula) and African marigolds (Tagetes erecta) are both well-suited to Sri Lankan conditions. French marigolds are more compact and better suited for small gardens or containers.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** 
Year-round in most parts of Sri Lanka, with best results during May to September

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Moisten the soil, then sow seeds 1 inch apart and no more than 1 inch deep |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Requires reasonably fertile well drained soil with a pH between 6.0 to 7.5 |
| Soil | Water well after planting |
| Light | Requires full sunshine |

### Growing conditions:

| Temperatures | Prefers daytime temperatures of 21-30°C (70-86°F) and nighttime temperatures around 13°C (55°F). In Sri Lanka, this can be achieved in most regions during the dry season |
|----|----|
| Soil | Better to improve poor soil with well-rotted compost. Add a layer of mulch between plants to suppress weeds and keep soil moist, especially when plants are young |
| Water | Water pot-grown marigolds regularly about 1 inch of water per week |
| Pruning | Not Applicable |
| Weed control | Remove weed |

## Harvesting:
Marigolds sprout within a week in warm weather and plants typically produce blooms in about 8 weeks. In Sri Lanka's tropical climate, flowering may occur even faster, sometimes within 6-7 weeks.

## Curing:
Gather the flowers and cut them close to the base. Thread them onto a string, either from bottom to top or side to side. Hang the garland in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight for 2-3 weeks to help preserve their color.

## Storage:
Once dried, store marigold flowers in a glass container or airtight bag to keep them free from moisture and pests. 

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:**
- Mealybugs
- Aphids
- Spider Mites
- Bud Borers
- Leaf Miners/Thrips

**Symptoms:**
- **Mealybugs:** White, cottony masses on young shoots, stems, and leaves; flattened and crinkled leaves turning dark green.
- **Aphids:** Yellow or brown speckling on leaves; tiny green insects on undersides of leaves and stems.
- **Spider Mites:** Whitish webs on plants; yellow speckling on leaves.
- **Bud Borers:** Damage to flower buds, which may appear shriveled or discolored.
- **Leaf Miners/Thrips:** Leaf distortion and damage due to feeding.

**Control method:**
- **Mealybugs:** Spray with Prophenophos at 2 ml/l or fish oil rosin soap at 25 g/l. Use Spinosad at 0.75 ml/l.
- **Aphids:** Use insecticides containing pyrethrum or spinosad soap.
- **Spider Mites:** Apply pyrethrum sprays.
- **Bud Borers:** Spray with Spinosad at 0.75 ml/l.
- **Leaf Miners/Thrips:** Use Fipronil at 1.5 ml/l.

### Disease Control

**Disease type:**
- Damping Off (Pythium sp.)
- Collar Rot (Phytophthora sp.; Pythium sp.)
- Leaf Spot and Blight (Alternaria, Cercospora, Septoria)
- Powdery Mildew (Oidium sp.; Leveillula taurica)
- Flower Bud Rot (Alternaria dianthi)

**Symptoms:**
- **Damping Off:** Seedlings develop necrotic spots and rings, leading to collapse.
- **Collar Rot:** Black lesions on the main stem, leading to plant death.
- **Leaf Spot and Blight:** Brown necrotic spots on leaves that enlarge over time, damaging foliage.
- **Powdery Mildew:** Whitish powdery growth on aerial parts of the plant.
- **Flower Bud Rot:** Infected buds shrivel and turn dark brown; older leaves show necrotic spots.

**Management:**
- **Damping Off:** Soil sterilization with Formalin at 2% before sowing and spraying Dithane Z-78 at 2 g/litre of water.
- **Collar Rot:** Soil sterilization, controlled watering; use fungicides like Captan and Mancozeb.
- **Leaf Spot and Blight:** Regular fungicide applications.
- **Powdery Mildew:** Spray with Sulfex (3 g/litre of water).
- **Flower Bud Rot:** Use Mancozeb at 2 g/litre of water.

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 3/10)
**Explanation:** Marigolds can tolerate some moisture but prefer well-drained soil. The warm and humid climate is suitable, but high rainfall may lead to waterlogging.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot.
- Provide adequate sunlight despite the tropical climate.
- Monitor plants for fungal diseases due to increased humidity.
- Consider raised beds or container gardening to improve drainage.
- Use organic fungicides like cinnamon powder or neem oil to prevent fungal infections.

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 2/10)
**Explanation:** Marigolds thrive in hot, sunny conditions with moderate watering. The dry season provides suitable temperatures and reduced rainfall.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.
- Protect plants from strong winds during the dry season.
- Use mulch to retain soil moisture and reduce water evaporation.
- Consider providing afternoon shade during extreme heat periods.

### Mid country (Difficulty: 3/10)
**Explanation:** Marigolds can tolerate cooler temperatures at night but prefer warmer days. The fluctuating temperatures and varying rainfall may pose challenges.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide some shade during the hottest part of the day.
- Ensure consistent watering as temperatures fluctuate.
- Monitor plants for signs of stress due to temperature changes.
- Use terraced gardening techniques to manage water runoff in sloped areas.
- Consider companion planting with taller plants to provide natural shade.

### Up country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Marigolds may struggle with cooler temperatures and shorter days in higher elevations. The lower rainfall is beneficial, but the cooler climate may limit growth.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide additional warmth using black plastic mulch sheets or row covers during cooler periods.
- Ensure plants receive adequate sunlight despite the cooler climate.
- Monitor plants for signs of stress due to cooler temperatures and shorter days.
- Choose varieties that are more tolerant to cooler temperatures, such as French marigolds.
- Consider greenhouse cultivation or use of polytunnels to extend the growing season.
