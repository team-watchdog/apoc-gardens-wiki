## Companion Plants

Marigolds are an excellent general-purpose plant that can help many other plants:

• Tomatoes: Marigolds repel pests that attack tomatoes and attract pollinators.
• Cucumbers: Marigolds help deter pests that commonly affect cucumbers.
• Squash: Marigolds attract pollinators and repel harmful insects that damage squash plants.
• Carrots: Marigolds have shallow roots, so they don't compete with carrots for nutrients.
• Radishes: Marigolds help prevent weed growth and attract pollinators for other crops.
• Lettuce: Marigolds deter slugs and beetles that can damage lettuce.
• Potatoes: Marigolds repel beetles and rabbits, and help control nematodes in the soil.
• Broccoli: Marigolds help keep harmful beetles and caterpillars away from broccoli plants.
• Basil: Marigolds prevent slugs and snails from harming basil plants.
• Sage: Marigolds help prevent aphids, spider mites, and slugs from damaging sage.
• Oregano: Together, they create a barrier against harmful insects for other crops.
• Thyme: Marigolds and thyme both repel bad insects while attracting beneficial ones.
• Dill: Marigolds help deter pests like caterpillars, rabbits, and slugs that can damage dill.
• Zinnias: They make great color combinations and both are drought-tolerant.
• Geraniums: Marigolds repel slugs that might otherwise damage geraniums.
• Nasturtium: Both repel harmful insects and attract beneficial ones.
• Vinca: Both are drought-tolerant and provide continuous blooms throughout the season.
• Petunias: Marigolds don't compete with petunias' high nutrient needs.

## Non-Companion Plants for Marigolds

• Beans: Marigolds can stunt the growth of bean plants.
• Cabbage: Marigolds may interfere with the growth of cabbage plants.


## Description:
Marigolds are cheerful, brilliantly coloured annuals that are long-standing favourite summer flowers for borders and pots. Colours are mainly yellow and orange with some reds and creamy white. All marigolds are excellent for attracting pollinating insects and are enormously useful as companion plants. In Sri Lanka, they are commonly used in religious ceremonies and as natural pest repellents in home gardens. French marigolds (Tagetes patula) and African marigolds (Tagetes erecta) are both well-suited to Sri Lankan conditions. French marigolds are more compact and better suited for small gardens or containers.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** 
Year-round in most parts of Sri Lanka, with best results during the dry season (May to September)

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Moisten the soil, then sow seeds 1 inch apart and no more than 1 inch deep |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Requires reasonably fertile well drained soil with a pH between 6.0 to 7.5 |
| Soil | Water well after planting |
| Light | Requires full sunshine |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Prefers daytime temperatures of 21-30°C (70-86°F) and nighttime temperatures around 13°C (55°F). In Sri Lanka, this can be achieved in most regions during the dry season |
|----|----|
| Soil | Better to improve poor soil with well-rotted compost. Add a layer of mulch between plants to suppress weeds and keep soil moist, especially when plants are young |
| Water | Water pot-grown marigolds regularly about 1 inch of water per week |
| Pruning | N/A |
| Weed control | Remove weed |

## Harvesting:
Flower within a few weeks of sowing. Marigolds sprout within a week in warm weather and plants typically produce blooms in about 8 weeks. In Sri Lanka's tropical climate, flowering may occur even faster, sometimes within 6-7 weeks.

## Protecting your plants

### Pest control
**Pest type:** Spider mites, Aphids, Powdery mildew, Thrips
**Control method:** Spray insecticides, spray water and remove weed. Regularly monitor plants for signs of pests. Use organic or chemical sprays as needed. Neem oil and garlic spray are popular organic pest control methods.

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 3/10)
**Explanation:** Marigolds can tolerate some moisture but prefer well-drained soil. The warm and humid climate is suitable, but the high rainfall may lead to waterlogging.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot.
- Provide adequate sunlight despite the tropical climate.
- Monitor plants for fungal diseases due to increased humidity.
- Consider raised beds or container gardening to improve drainage.
- Use organic fungicides like cinnamon powder or neem oil to prevent fungal infections.

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 2/10)
**Explanation:** Marigolds thrive in hot, sunny conditions with moderate watering. The dry season provides suitable temperatures and reduced rainfall.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.
- Protect plants from strong winds during the dry season.
- Use mulch to retain soil moisture and reduce water evaporation.
- Consider providing afternoon shade during extreme heat periods.

### Mid country (Difficulty: 3/10)
**Explanation:** Marigolds can tolerate cooler temperatures at night but prefer warmer days. The fluctuating temperatures and varying rainfall may pose challenges.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide some shade during the hottest part of the day.
- Ensure consistent watering as temperatures fluctuate.
- Monitor plants for signs of stress due to temperature changes.
- Use terraced gardening techniques to manage water runoff in sloped areas.
- Consider companion planting with taller plants to provide natural shade.

### Up country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Marigolds may struggle with cooler temperatures and shorter days in higher elevations. The lower rainfall is beneficial, but the cooler climate may limit growth.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide additional warmth using black plastic mulch or row covers during cooler periods.
- Ensure plants receive adequate sunlight despite the cooler climate.
- Monitor plants for signs of stress due to cooler temperatures and shorter days.
- Choose varieties that are more tolerant to cooler temperatures, such as French marigolds.
- Consider greenhouse cultivation or use of polytunnels to extend the growing season.
