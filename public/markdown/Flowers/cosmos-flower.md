## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Year round

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Propagate from seeds |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Prepare the seed bed area by removing clumps of soil to achieve a crumbly texture. Sow seeds lightly, spaced about 2-3in (5-8 cm) apart |
| Soil | Prefers well-drained light soil and does not require any special soil preparation |
| Water | Can tolerate dry soil but prefers moist soil |
| Light | Requires full sunshine |
| Fertiliser | _**Do not fertilize cosmos**_. Nutrient-rich soil produces plants that are weak-stemmed |

### Growing conditions:
| Temperatures | Thrives in climate with temperatures between 20°C to 24°C. At temperatures above 27°C and below 16°C germination is reduced |
|----|----|
| Soil | Better to mulch the garden for moisture retention |
| Water | Water regularly, but do not overwater |
| Weed control | Keep the area weed free |

## Harvesting:
Cut the flowers anytime after blooming when the petals are open.

## Curing:

## Storage
Dry blooms in a well-ventilated area, away from sunlight, or use a food dryer. Naturally dried flowers should take 1 to 5 days. Store in a moisture-tight container in a cool, dark place.
