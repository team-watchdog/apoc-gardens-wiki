## Description:
Chilli is a spicy fruit used in cuisine preparations. It is mostly added as an ingredient in foods to make it spicy. Apart from this, chilies also possess medicinal properties. In Sri Lanka, green chilies are an essential ingredient in many traditional dishes and are often used fresh or in dried form.

## Planting requirements
- Grows in warm humid climate

**Planting season:** Can be cultivated all year round under controlled conditions.
- **High Season:** Late October - Mid November
- **Young Season:** April - Early May
  
### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Seeds |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Grow in seed trays, and plant the seedlings in 4-6 weeks. Better to plant them on beds for better root growth and also protection from stagnant water |
| Soil | Can be grown in a range of soil though sandy loamy soil is preferred due to its good drainage properties. Needs a soil pH between 6.5 and 7.5 (neutral soil). |
| Water | Chilies cannot withstand heavy moisture and hence irrigation should be given when necessary. Water regularly, but avoid overwatering to prevent root rot |
| Light | Requires at least 8 hours of sunlight per day |

### Growing conditions:

| Temperatures | Optimal daytime temperature is around 21-27Â°C |
|----|----|
| Soil | Land should be prepared by ploughing and mixing compost about 15-20 days before sowing. Soil should be well-prepared with plenty of organic matter |
| Water | Proper irrigation will also improve flowering and fruit setting. Therefore, better to irrigate based on the water-holding capacity of the soil as well as the type of soil. Water deeply once a week, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings |
| Pruning | Prune plants in late winter or early spring to encourage bushier growth and remove any dead or diseased foliage |
| Weeding | Whenever possible, keep the plantation free of weeds. |

## Harvesting:
Pick them after 70-80 days after planting

## Curing:

## Storage:

## Protecting your plants:

## Pest control
**Pest type:** Aphids, jassids, thrips, mites, leaf-eating caterpillars, and fruit borers
**Symptoms:** 
**Control method:** Spray insecticides, removing infected plants, splashing water. Use organic or chemical pesticides sparingly. Encourage natural predators like ladybugs and lacewings. <update>In Sri Lanka, neem oil and garlic spray are popular organic pest control methods.</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** The warm, humid conditions of the low country wet zone are generally suitable for chili cultivation, but excess moisture can be problematic.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Requires well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging
- May need raised beds to improve drainage
- Higher risk of fungal diseases due to humidity; regular monitoring needed

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** The warm climate of the low country dry zone is favorable for chili growth, with proper irrigation.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Requires consistent irrigation, especially during dry spells
- Mulching is essential to retain soil moisture
- May need shade during extreme heat to prevent sunscald on fruits

### Mid country (Difficulty: 3/10)
**Explanation:** The moderate climate of the midcountry provides good conditions for chilli cultivation.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- May require some irrigation during dry periods
- Basic pest and disease monitoring
- Soil preparation with organic matter is crucial for optimal growth

### Up country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Chilli can be grown in the upcountry, but cooler temperatures and potentially higher rainfall present challenges.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- May require protection during colder months
- Longer growing season due to cooler temperatures
- Extra attention to drainage in areas with higher rainfall
- May need to select varieties better suited to cooler climates
