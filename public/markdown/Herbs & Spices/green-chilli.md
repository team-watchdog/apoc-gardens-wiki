## Description:
Chilli is a spicy fruit used in cuisine preparations. It is mostly added as an ingredient in foods to make it spicy. Apart from this, chillies also possess medicinal properties. <update>In Sri Lanka, green chillies are an essential ingredient in many traditional dishes and are often used fresh or in dried form.</update>

## Planting requirements
- Grows in warm humid climate
**Planting season:** <update>Year-round in most parts of Sri Lanka, but best planted at the beginning of the monsoon seasons (May-June or September-October)</update>

### Planting conditions:

| **Propagation** | Seeds |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Grow in seed trays, and plant the seedlings in 4-6 weeks. Better to plant them on beds for better root growth and also protection from stagnant water |
| Soil | Can be grown in a range of soil though sandy loamy soil is preferred due to its well drainage properties. Needs a soil pH between 6.5 and 7.5 (neutral soil). Soil should be well-draining with plenty of organic matter |
| Water | Chilies cannot withstand heavy moisture and hence irrigation should be given when necessary. Water regularly, but avoid overwatering to prevent root rot |
| Light | Requires at least 8 hours of sunlight per day |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Optimal daytime temperature is around 70-85°F (21-29°C) |
|----|----|
| Soil | Land should be prepared by ploughing and mixing compost about 15-20 days prior to sowing. Soil should be well-prepared with plenty of organic matter |
| Water | Proper irrigation will also improve flowering and fruit setting. Therefore, better to irrigate based on the water holding capacity of the soil as well as the type of soil. Water deeply once a week, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings |
| Pruning | Prune plants in late winter or early spring to encourage bushier growth and remove any dead or diseased foliage |

## Harvesting:
Pick them after 9-11 weeks when the fruit is mature. <update>Harvest green chillies when they are fully grown but still green. For red chillies, wait until they turn completely red before picking</update>

## Protecting your plants:

## Pest control
**Pest type:** Aphids, jassids, thrips, mites, leaf eating caterpillars and fruit borers
**Symptoms:** 
**Control method:** Spray insecticides, removing infected plants, splashing water. Use organic or chemical pesticides sparingly. Encourage natural predators like ladybugs and lacewings. <update>In Sri Lanka, neem oil and garlic spray are popular organic pest control methods.</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** The warm, humid conditions of the low country wet zone are generally suitable for chilli cultivation, but excess moisture can be problematic.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Requires well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging
- May need raised beds to improve drainage
- Higher risk of fungal diseases due to humidity; regular monitoring needed

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** The warm climate of the low country dry zone is favorable for chilli growth, with proper irrigation.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Requires consistent irrigation, especially during dry spells
- Mulching is essential to retain soil moisture
- May need shade during extreme heat to prevent sunscald on fruits

### Mid country (Difficulty: 3/10)
**Explanation:** The moderate climate of the mid country provides good conditions for chilli cultivation.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- May require some irrigation during dry periods
- Basic pest and disease monitoring
- Soil preparation with organic matter is crucial for optimal growth

### Up country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Chilli can be grown in the up country, but cooler temperatures and potentially higher rainfall present challenges.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- May require protection from frost in some areas during colder months
- Longer growing season due to cooler temperatures
- Extra attention to drainage in areas with higher rainfall
- May need to select varieties better suited to cooler climates
