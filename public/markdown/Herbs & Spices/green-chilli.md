## Description:
Chilli is a spicy fruit used in cuisine preparations. It is mostly added as an ingredient in foods to make it spicy. Apart from this, chillies also possess medicinal properties. <update>In Sri Lanka, green chillies are an essential ingredient in many traditional dishes and are often used fresh or in dried form.</update>

## Planting requirements
- Grows in warm humid climate
**Planting season:** <update>Year-round in most parts of Sri Lanka, but best planted at the beginning of the monsoon seasons (May-June or September-October)</update>

### Planting conditions:

| **Propagation** | Seeds |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Grow in seed trays, and plant the seedlings in 4-6 weeks. Better to plant them on beds for better root growth and also protection from stagnant water |
| Soil | Can be grown in a range of soil though sandy loamy soil is preferred due to its well drainage properties. Needs a soil pH between 6.5 and 7.5 (neutral soil). Soil should be well-draining with plenty of organic matter |
| Water | Chilies cannot withstand heavy moisture and hence irrigation should be given when necessary. Water regularly, but avoid overwatering to prevent root rot |
| Light | Requires at least 8 hours of sunlight per day |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Optimal daytime temperature is around 70-85°F (21-29°C) |
|----|----|
| Soil | Land should be prepared by ploughing and mixing compost about 15-20 days prior to sowing. Soil should be well-prepared with plenty of organic matter |
| Water | Proper irrigation will also improve flowering and fruit setting. Therefore, better to irrigate based on the water holding capacity of the soil as well as the type of soil. Water deeply once a week, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings |
| Pruning | Prune plants in late winter or early spring to encourage bushier growth and remove any dead or diseased foliage |

## Harvesting:
Pick them after 9-11 weeks when the fruit is mature. <update>Harvest green chillies when they are fully grown but still green. For red chillies, wait until they turn completely red before picking</update>

## Pest control
**Pest type:** Aphids, jassids, thrips, mites, leaf eating caterpillars and fruit borers
**Symptoms:** 
**Control method:** Spray insecticides, removing infected plants, splashing water. Use organic or chemical pesticides sparingly. Encourage natural predators like ladybugs and lacewings. <update>In Sri Lanka, neem oil and garlic spray are popular organic pest control methods.</update>

## Difficulty Ratings by Climate Zone in Sri Lanka

### 1. **Humid Tropical Lowlands (Sea Level - 100m)**
- *Difficulty Rating:* 6/10
- *Explanation:* This zone has high temperatures and humidity, which can lead to fungal diseases in chillies. The heavy rainfall may also cause waterlogging, leading to root rot. Regular monitoring for pests and diseases is crucial.

### 2. **Humid Tropical Wet Zone (100m - 500m)**
- *Difficulty Rating:* 7/10
- *Explanation:* This zone experiences high rainfall, which can lead to similar issues as the lowlands. Additionally, the cooler temperatures may slow down plant growth and reduce yields.

### 3. **Humid Tropical Dry Zone (500m - 1524m)**
- *Difficulty Rating:* 5/10
- *Explanation:* This zone has a distinct dry season, which can cause water stress in chillies if not managed properly with irrigation. However, the cooler temperatures may also help to prevent fungal diseases.

### 4. **Subtropical Highland (Above 1524m)**
- *Difficulty Rating:* 8/10
- *Explanation:* This zone has cool temperatures that are below the optimal range for chillies. Chillies may take longer to mature, and yields could be lower. Greenhouses or row covers may be necessary to protect plants from frost.

**Challenges and Adaptations:**
- *Waterlogging:* Ensure proper drainage in planting beds.
- *Fungal diseases:* Practice crop rotation, maintain plant spacing for air circulation, and use fungicides if necessary.
- *Temperature extremes:* Use greenhouses or row covers to protect plants from extreme temperatures.
<update>
- *Monsoon rains:* Use raised beds or plastic mulch to protect plants from excessive moisture during heavy rains.
- *Drought:* Implement drip irrigation systems for efficient water use during dry periods.
- *Pest management:* Utilize integrated pest management techniques, including the use of traditional Sri Lankan methods like neem oil sprays.
