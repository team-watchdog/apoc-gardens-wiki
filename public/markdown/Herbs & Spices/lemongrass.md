## Description:
Lemongrass is a fragrant, lemony herb native to tropical climates. In Sri Lanka and other Asian cuisines, its stem is widely used in fish and meat dishes, while its leaves make a refreshing tea. It can be used fresh or dried and powdered. Beyond culinary uses, lemongrass serves as an attractive ornamental plant, growing up to 6 feet in height and width. Its natural pest-repellent properties make it a valuable addition to any garden.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Year-round in Sri Lanka, with optimal planting at the onset of rainy seasons (May-June or October-November)

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Use seeds or supermarket-bought stems |
|--------|----------------|
| Planting method | Prefer pots for better control. Plant seeds 6 inches apart; transplant seedlings 1-2 feet apart when a few inches tall |
| Soil | Rich in nutrients, especially nitrogen. Prepare by mixing with compost or manure |
| Water | Requires consistent moisture with good drainage |
| Light | Full sunshine, minimum 6 hours daily |

### Growing conditions:
| Temperature | Thrives in Sri Lankan climate (25-35Â°C) |
|--------|----------------|
| Soil maintenance | Apply 3-inch layer of mulch to conserve moisture and enrich soil |
| Watering | Regular watering during dry periods, especially in dry zones |
| Pruning | Annual pruning encourages bushier growth |
| Weed control | Keep area around plants weed-free to prevent nutrient competition |

## Harvesting:
First harvest at 3-6 months, then every three months. Yield increases after the first year. Harvest on sunny days, cutting 10cm above ground. Allow harvested grass to wilt in the field for two days before bundling.

## Curing:
Tie stalks in bundles and hang upside down in a well-ventilated, shaded area to dry.

## Storage
Store dried lemongrass in airtight containers in a cool, dark place for up to 6 months. Refrigerate fresh lemongrass for up to two weeks.

## Processing for oil
Extract lemongrass oil using water distillation. Oil quality depends on citral content and alcohol solubility. Commercial lemongrass (Cymbopogon flexuosus) should have over 75% citral content and be soluble in 70% ethyl alcohol. Sera (Cymbopogon citratus) oil has lower citral content and is insoluble in 70% alcohol.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest Control
**Pest type:**
- Aphids
- Mealybugs

**Symptoms:**
- **Aphids:** Yellowing leaves and distorted growth.
- **Mealybugs:** Appear as white, cottony masses.

**Control method:**
- **Aphids:** Water spray, pruning, and insecticidal soap.
- **Mealybugs:** Neem oil or natural predators like ladybugs.

### Disease Control
**Disease type:**
- Rust
- Root rot

**Symptoms:**
- **Rust:** Orange or brown leaf spots.
- **Root rot:** Wilting and yellowing.

**Management:**
- **Rust:** Avoid overhead watering, remove infected leaves, and ensure good air circulation.
- **Root rot:** Improve soil drainage and avoid overwatering. Use fungicides as a last resort.

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Ideal climate with hot, humid conditions matching lemongrass preferences.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging
- Consider raised beds or pots in high-rainfall areas
- Use organic mulch to prevent soil erosion

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Suitable climate, but requires attention to moisture levels.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Water regularly, especially in dry seasons
- Apply thick mulch layer to retain soil moisture
- Consider drip irrigation for consistent watering

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Generally favorable climate within lemongrass's preferred temperature range.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide shade during extreme heat
- Ensure good air circulation in humid areas
- Choose sunny locations in cooler regions

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Cooler temperatures present challenges, but cultivation is possible with care.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Select warmest, sunniest planting locations
- Ensure excellent drainage in high-rainfall areas
- Use containers for mobility during cold spells
- Apply mulch to maintain soil temperature and moisture
