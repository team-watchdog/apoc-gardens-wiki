## Description:
Lemongrass is a sweet, lemony herb native to tropical climates. The stem is widely used in <update>Sri Lankan and other Asian cuisines</update> for fish and meat dishes. The leaves are also used to make refreshing tea. Apart from its culinary use, lemongrass makes an attractive plant that can grow up to 6 feet tall with the same diameter. Lemongrass has fragrant properties that act as a pest repellent.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>Can be planted year-round in Sri Lanka, but best planted at the beginning of the rainy season (May-June or October-November)</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Can either grow lemongrass from seed or from a supermarket-bought stem |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Better to grow them in pots. They need plenty of room to grow. Plant the seeds in a container 6 inches apart and once the seedlings are few inches tall, plant them 1-2 feet apart. |
| Soil | Prefers soil rich in nutrients. Nitrogen-rich soil is ideal. Prepare the soil by mixing with compost or manure before planting |
| Water | Lemongrass needs lots of moisture but well-drained soil. Keep the soil moist and ensure that the soil does not dry out |
| Light | Requires full sunshine, at least 6 hours of direct sunshine per day |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | <update>Thrives in Sri Lankan climate with temperatures between 25-35Â°C</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | Putting about 3 inch layer of mulch will help conserve soil moisture and enrich the soil as it breaks down |
| Water | <update>Water regularly during dry periods, especially in the dry zone</update> |
| Pruning | Prune the plant annually to encourage bushier growth. |
| Weed control | Keep the area around the lemongrass free of weeds to prevent competition for nutrients and water. |

## Harvesting:
Once the plant is mature and produces lots of stems (at least 10), cut the stems just below the base. Make sure you leave plenty on the plant to allow it to produce new growth.

## Curing: 
<update>After harvesting, tie the stalks in bundles and hang them upside down in a well-ventilated area out of direct sunlight to dry.</update>

## Storage: 
<update>Store dried lemongrass in an airtight container in a cool, dark place for up to 6 months. Fresh lemongrass can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** <update>Aphids, Mealybugs</update>

**Symptoms:** Aphids cause yellowing leaves and distorted growth. <update>Mealybugs appear as white, cottony masses on stems and leaves.</update>

**Control method:** Wash the plant with water, prune diseased leaves, and use insecticidal soap for aphids. <update>For mealybugs, use neem oil or introduce natural predators like ladybugs.</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** <update>Rust, Root rot</update>

**Symptoms:** <update>Rust appears as orange or brown spots on leaves. Root rot causes wilting and yellowing of leaves.</update>

**Management:** <update>Avoid overhead watering, remove infected leaves, and provide good air circulation. For root rot, improve soil drainage and avoid overwatering. Use fungicides only as a last resort.</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Lemongrass thrives in hot, humid climates but requires well-drained soil. The wet zone's high rainfall and humidity can lead to root rot if the soil is not properly drained.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure proper drainage by mixing sand or perlite into the soil.
- Consider planting in raised beds or pots with drainage holes.
<update>- Use organic mulch to prevent soil erosion during heavy rains.</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Lemongrass prefers consistently moist soil but can tolerate some drought once established. The dry zone's lower rainfall may require more frequent watering.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Water regularly, especially during the dry season.
- Apply a thick layer of organic mulch to retain soil moisture.
<update>- Consider using drip irrigation to conserve water.</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** The mid-country's cooler temperatures and varying rainfall can make growing lemongrass more challenging. Lemongrass is not frost tolerant, so protection may be needed during cold spells.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide some shade during the hottest part of the day.
- Protect from frost by covering with a frost cloth or moving pots indoors overnight.
<update>- Plant in areas with good air circulation to prevent fungal diseases.</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 8/10)
**Explanation:** The up-country's cooler temperatures and higher rainfall can make growing lemongrass difficult. Lemongrass is not frost tolerant, and excessive rain can lead to root rot.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide some shade during the hottest part of the day.
- Ensure proper drainage by planting in raised beds or pots with drainage holes.
- Protect from frost by covering with a frost cloth or moving pots indoors overnight.
<update>- Consider growing in greenhouses or polytunnels for better temperature control.</update>
