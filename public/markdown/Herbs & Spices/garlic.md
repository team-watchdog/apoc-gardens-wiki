## Description:
Garlic is one of the most popular herbs in all forms of cooking, and there are dozens of varieties available. Garlic falls into two broad categories: hardneck (also known as "stiffneck") and softneck. This differentiation is based upon whether or not the particular variety of garlic creates a flower stalk. <update>In Sri Lanka, softneck varieties are more commonly grown due to their adaptability to warmer climates.</update>

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>late May through early July, during the Yala season</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Pick off individual cloves from the garlic bulbs and plant them |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Plant each of the garlic cloves in a hole deep enough to leave the top just covered with soil. Plant them four inches apart in rows close together or four inches in all directions in deep bed |
| Soil | Requires a good rich soil as onions need. Prefers a soil with plenty of manure and compost. Remove the weeds when preparing the soil. Also can add organic potting mix to your existing garden soil until it is friable and loose; pH should be between 6.0-7.5 |
| Water | Do not require much water. However, provide the plants with a good soak after planting to accelerate growth. Water regularly during the growing season, about an inch of water per week. |
| Light | Requires plenty of sunshine |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | <update>Requires soil temperatures between 20°C and 30°C</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | Mulching is important for garlic plants as mulching act as an insulator while conserving moisture for the garlic plant. Mulching helps prevent weed growth. Use organic materials like straw, well-rotted grass clippings or leaves. |
| Water | Better to water every day during the growing season but best practice is to check the soil under the mulch before watering. Water deeply once a week, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. |
| Pruning | Prune flower stalks (scape) when they appear to encourage bulb growth. Remove any flowering heads that form on the scape. |
| Weed control | Keep weeds at bay by regular hoeing and hand-pulling. Use organic herbicides if necessary. |

## Harvesting:
Fork the garlic out of the ground when the stems dry up and dry them out for a few days in the sun. Harvest when the tops turn brown and fall over, usually after 17 -25 weeks.

## Curing:
<update>Cure garlic by hanging it in a well-ventilated area with low humidity (60-70°F/15-21°C) for about two weeks to prevent sprouting and improve storage life.
</update>

## Storage: 
<update>Store cured garlic bulbs in a cool, dry place at temperatures between 32-40°F (0-4°C). Use within six months for best quality.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:**  Cutworms, pink stalk borer, bulb mites, leaf miners, onion maggots and thrips

**Symptoms:** <update>Holes in leaves or stems, wilting, discolored leaves.</update>

**Control method:** Spray organic pesticides, neem oil, remove affected plants. 
<update>Use row covers to protect young plants. Apply diatomaceous earth around the base of plants to deter pests.</update>

### Disease Control
<update>
**Disease type:** Garlic rust, white rot, basal rot, and smut.

**Symptoms:** Orange or brown spots on leaves (rust), water-soaked lesions on bulbs (white rot), rotting at the base of plants (basal rot), black or purple streaks in the bulb (smut).

**Management:** Avoid overhead watering, rotate crops, use disease-resistant varieties. Apply fungicides if necessary.

## Difficulty Ratings 

### 1. **Humid Tropical Lowland Zone**
- *Difficulty Rating:* 5/10
- *Explanation:* This zone has suitable temperatures (27-32°C) and high humidity, which are favorable for garlic growth. However, the heavy rainfall may lead to increased risk of diseases like white rot and basal rot. Regular monitoring and timely fungicide application would be necessary.

### 2. **Arid Intermediate Zone**
- *Difficulty Rating:* 6/10
- *Explanation:* This zone experiences hotter temperatures (32-40°C) and lower rainfall, which can cause water stress for garlic plants. Regular deep watering is crucial to maintain soil moisture. Additionally, the risk of pests like onion maggots may increase due to higher temperatures.

### 3. **Wet Intermediate Zone**
- *Difficulty Rating:* 4/10
- *Explanation:* This zone has suitable temperatures (27-32°C) and high rainfall, which are favorable for garlic growth. However, the heavy rainfall may lead to increased risk of diseases like white rot and basal rot. Regular monitoring and timely fungicide application would be necessary.

### 4. **Humid Uplands Zone**
- *Difficulty Rating:* 7/10
- *Explanation:* This zone has cooler temperatures (18-26°C), which are below the optimal range for garlic growth. Garlic may require additional heat during the day and protection from cold nights. Additionally, the risk of pests like cutworms may increase due to cooler temperatures.

**Key Challenges:**
- Maintaining optimal soil moisture levels in all zones.
- Controlling diseases like white rot and basal rot in humid zones.
- Managing pests like onion maggots in hotter zones.
- Providing additional heat for garlic plants in cooler upland zones.
