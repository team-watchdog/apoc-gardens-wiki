## Description:
Garlic is one of the most popular herbs in all forms of cooking, and there are dozens of varieties available. Garlic falls into two broad categories: hardneck (also known as "stiffneck") and softneck. This differentiation is based upon whether or not the particular variety of garlic creates a flower stalk. <update>In Sri Lanka, softneck varieties are more commonly grown due to their adaptability to warmer climates.</update>

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>late May through early July, during the Yala season</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Pick off individual cloves from the garlic bulbs and plant them |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Plant each of the garlic cloves in a hole deep enough to leave the top just covered with soil. Plant them four inches apart in rows close together or four inches in all directions in deep bed |
| Soil | Requires a good rich soil as onions need. Prefers a soil with plenty of manure and compost. Remove the weeds when preparing the soil. Also can add organic potting mix to your existing garden soil until it is friable and loose; pH should be between 6.0-7.5 |
| Water | Do not require much water. However, provide the plants with a good soak after planting to accelerate growth. Water regularly during the growing season, about an inch of water per week. |
| Light | Requires plenty of sunshine |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | <update>Requires soil temperatures between 20°C and 30°C</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | Mulching is important for garlic plants as mulching act as an insulator while conserving moisture for the garlic plant. Mulching helps prevent weed growth. Use organic materials like straw, well-rotted grass clippings or leaves. |
| Water | Better to water every day during the growing season but best practice is to check the soil under the mulch before watering. Water deeply once a week, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. |
| Pruning | Prune flower stalks (scape) when they appear to encourage bulb growth. Remove any flowering heads that form on the scape. |
| Weed control | Keep weeds at bay by regular hoeing and hand-pulling. Use organic herbicides if necessary. |

## Harvesting:
Fork the garlic out of the ground when the stems dry up and dry them out for a few days in the sun. Harvest when the tops turn brown and fall over, usually after 17 -25 weeks.

## Curing:
<update>Cure garlic by hanging it in a well-ventilated area with low humidity (60-70°F/15-21°C) for about two weeks to prevent sprouting and improve storage life.
</update>

## Storage: 
<update>Store cured garlic bulbs in a cool, dry place at temperatures between 32-40°F (0-4°C). Use within six months for best quality.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:**  Cutworms, pink stalk borer, bulb mites, leaf miners, onion maggots and thrips

**Symptoms:** <update>Holes in leaves or stems, wilting, discolored leaves.</update>

**Control method:** Spray organic pesticides, neem oil, remove affected plants. 
<update>Use row covers to protect young plants. Apply diatomaceous earth around the base of plants to deter pests.</update>

### Disease Control
<update>
**Disease type:** Garlic rust, white rot, basal rot, and smut.

**Symptoms:** Orange or brown spots on leaves (rust), water-soaked lesions on bulbs (white rot), rotting at the base of plants (basal rot), black or purple streaks in the bulb (smut).

**Management:** Avoid overhead watering, rotate crops, use disease-resistant varieties. Apply fungicides if necessary.

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** The warm, humid conditions of the low country wet zone can be challenging for garlic cultivation.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- High humidity increases risk of fungal diseases
- Requires well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging
- May need to select softneck varieties more suited to warmer climates

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** The warm, drier climate of the low country dry zone is more suitable for garlic, but irrigation is crucial.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Requires regular irrigation, especially during dry spells
- Mulching is essential to retain soil moisture and regulate temperature
- Pest control, particularly for thrips and bulb mites, may be necessary

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** The moderate climate of the mid country provides relatively favorable conditions for garlic growth.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- May require some irrigation during dry periods
- Attention to soil preparation and enrichment is important
- Regular monitoring for pests and diseases is necessary

### Up country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** The cooler temperatures of the up country are generally suitable for garlic cultivation.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Longer growing season may be required due to cooler temperatures
- Proper drainage is crucial to prevent waterlogging in areas with higher rainfall
- Protection from frost may be necessary in some areas during colder months
