## Description:
Garlic is one of the most popular herbs in all forms of cooking, and there are dozens of varieties available. Garlic falls into two broad categories: hardneck (also known as "stiffneck") and softneck. This differentiation is based on whether or not the particular variety of garlic creates a flower stalk.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>late May through early July, during the Yala season</update>

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Pick off individual cloves from the garlic bulbs and plant them |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Plant each of the garlic cloves in a hole deep enough to leave the top just covered with soil. Plant them four inches apart in rows close together or four inches in all directions in a deep bed |
| Soil | Requires a good rich soil as onions need. Prefers a soil with plenty of manure and compost. Remove the weeds when preparing the soil. Also can add organic potting mix to your existing garden soil until it is friable and loose; pH should be between 6.0 and 7.5 |
| Water | Do not require much water. However, provide the plants with a good soak after planting to accelerate growth. Water regularly during the growing season, about an inch of water per week. |
| Light | Requires plenty of sunshine |

### Growing conditions:

| Temperatures | Requires soil temperatures around 10°C |
|----|----|
| Soil | Mulching is important for garlic plants as mulching acts as an insulator while conserving moisture for the garlic plant. Mulching helps prevent weed growth. Use organic materials like straw, well-rotted grass clippings, or leaves. |
| Water | Better to water every day during the growing season but the best practice is to check the soil under the mulch before watering. Water deeply once a week, allowing the top inch of soil to dry out between waterings. |
| Pruning | Prune flower stalks (scape) when they appear to encourage bulb growth. Remove any flowering heads that form on the scape. |
| Weed control | Keep weeds at bay by regular hoeing and hand-pulling. Use organic herbicides if necessary. |

## Harvesting:
Fork the garlic out of the ground when the stems dry up and dry them out for a few days in the sun. Harvest when the tops turn brown and fall over, usually after 17 -25 weeks.

## Curing:
Cure garlic by hanging it in a well-ventilated area with low humidity for about two weeks to prevent sprouting and improve storage life. Curing is complete when the outer skins are dry and crispy, the neck is constricted, and the center of the cut stem is hard.

## Storage: 
Store cured garlic bulbs in a cool, dry place at temperatures between 68-86°F (20-30°C). However, under these conditions, bulbs will eventually become soft, spongy, and shriveled due to water loss. 

To store for a longer time keep in 30-32°F with low relative humidity. Good airflow throughout the storage containers is necessary to prevent any moisture accumulation. Under these conditions, well-cured garlic can be stored for 6-7 months.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** 
- Thrips (_Thysanoptera_)

**Symptoms:** 
- **Thrips:** Common under hot conditions. The leaves of the plant turn white or silver. Can be found hidden in between leaves. 

**Control method:** 
- **Thrips:** Spray organic pesticides, neem oil, remove affected plants. 

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** 
- Purple Blotch (_Alternaria porri_)

**Symptoms:**
- **Purple blotch:** Small purple patches are found on young leaves, with the prolonged condition the leaf turns brown and the plant gets weaker.

**Management:** 
- **Purple blotch:** Avoid overhead watering, rotate crops, and use disease-resistant varieties. Apply fungicides if necessary.

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** The warm, humid conditions of the low country wet zone can be challenging for garlic cultivation.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- High humidity increases the risk of fungal diseases
- Requires well-draining soil to prevent waterlogging
- May need to select soft neck varieties more suited to warmer climates

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** The warm, drier climate of the low country dry zone is more suitable for garlic, but irrigation is crucial.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Requires regular irrigation, especially during dry spells
- Mulching is essential to retain soil moisture and regulate temperature
- Pest control, particularly for thrips and bulb mites, may be necessary

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** The moderate climate of the mid country provides relatively favorable conditions for garlic growth.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- May require some irrigation during dry periods
- Attention to soil preparation and enrichment is important
- Regular monitoring for pests and diseases is necessary

### Up country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** The cooler temperatures of the up country are generally suitable for garlic cultivation.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- A longer growing season may be required due to cooler temperatures
- Proper drainage is crucial to prevent waterlogging in areas with higher rainfall
- Protection from frost may be necessary in some areas during colder months
