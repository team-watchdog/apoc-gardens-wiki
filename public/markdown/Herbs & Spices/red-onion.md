## Description:
Onions are an essential ingredient in Sri Lankan cuisine and have been grown for centuries. It can be grown the year around in many different climatic conditions, though the right timing and the method depends largely on where we live. However, they prefer cool weather during the leaf developing stage while much hotter weather during the bulb producing stage. There are different varieties of onions.
<update>They can be cultivated year-round in many parts of Sri Lanka, though the ideal growing season varies depending on the region. Red onions are particularly well-suited to Sri Lankan conditions and are widely grown across the country.</update>

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>Maha season (October to January), Yala season (April to August)</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Onions can be propagated from seed, transplants, and bulbs |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Onions are typically planted as either bulbs (known as "sets") or transplants. Grow seeds in seed trays, and plant out the seedlings in 4-6 weeks. Sow them at a depth approximately three times the diameter of the seed. |
| Soil | <update>Onions prefer well-draining, fertile soil. In Sri Lanka, it's important to mix the soil with organic matter such as compost or well-rotted cow manure to improve fertility and water retention.</update> |
| Water | <update>Onions require consistent moisture, especially during bulb formation. In drier regions of Sri Lanka, regular irrigation is crucial.</update> |
| Light | <update>Onions need full sun exposure, which is generally abundant in Sri Lanka. However, in extremely hot areas, some light shading during the hottest part of the day may be beneficial.</update> |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | <update>Onions in Sri Lanka grow best in temperatures between 20°C and 30°C</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | <update>Maintain soil pH between 6.0 and 6.8. In more acidic soils common in some parts of Sri Lanka, add lime to adjust the pH.</update> |
| Water | <update>In Sri Lanka's climate, water deeply once or twice a week, depending on rainfall. Drip irrigation is effective in conserving water and preventing leaf diseases.</update> |
| Pruning | <update>Topping: When the tops start falling over, bend them down and break their necks to encourage bulb ripening. This practice is particularly important in humid regions to prevent rotting.</update> |
| Weed control | <update>Regular weeding is crucial, especially in the initial stages of growth. Mulching with rice straw or coconut husk can help suppress weeds and retain soil moisture.</update> |

## Harvesting:
Can be harvested within 25-34 weeks. When the tips of the leaves start turning yellow, bend over and break the necks of the onions. This starts the ripening process. Also,  loosen the onions with a fork to start them drying without damaging the skin. Ease the onions out of the ground and leave them a week or two in the sun to dry. It is important to dry the onions well.

<update>In Sri Lankan conditions, onions can typically be harvested within 90-120 days after planting, depending on the variety and growing conditions. When the tops start to yellow and fall over, stop watering and allow the soil to dry out for a few days before harvesting.</update>

## Curing:
<update>After harvesting, cure onions by laying them out in a single layer in a warm, dry, well-ventilated area for about 2 weeks. This process is crucial in Sri Lanka's humid climate to prevent spoilage and extend storage life.</update>

## Storage
<update>Store cured onions in a cool, dry place with good air circulation. In Sri Lanka's tropical climate, it's challenging to store onions for extended periods. Use mesh bags or open-weave baskets to ensure good airflow. Regularly check and remove any spoiling onions to prevent spread.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Onion fly, Downy mildew, Eelworm, Neck rot, Onion smut <update>Leaf miners</update>

**Symptoms:** <update>Onion fly: Wilting and yellowing of leaves, maggots in bulbs; Thrips: Silvery patches on leaves; Leaf miners: Tunnels within leaves</update>

**Control method:** <update>Use neem oil sprays, install yellow sticky traps, practice crop rotation. In severe cases, use locally approved insecticides following proper guidelines.</update>

Crop rotation, well drained soil with good exposure to the sun, using mulch/organic matter, apply organic measures such as sprinkling some chili powder, ginger, or pepper directly on the soil, planting companion plants that are insect repellents

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** <update>Purple blotch, Fusarium basal rot</update>

**Symptoms:** <update>Purple blotch: Purple lesions on leaves; Fusarium basal rot: Yellowing and wilting of leaves, rotting of bulb base</update>

**Management:** <update>Improve soil drainage, practice crop rotation, use disease-resistant varieties when available. Apply copper-based fungicides as a preventive measure, especially during rainy periods.</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** <update>High humidity and rainfall increase disease risk, making onion cultivation challenging in this zone.</update>
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Use raised beds to improve drainage</update>
- <update>Implement a strict fungicide regimen during rainy periods</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Ideal conditions for onion growth, but irrigation is crucial</update>
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Implement efficient irrigation systems like drip irrigation</update>
- <update>Use mulch to conserve soil moisture</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Moderate conditions, but may face challenges with sudden weather changes</update>
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Use row covers to protect from unexpected rain or temperature fluctuations</update>
- <update>Choose varieties suited for mid-country conditions</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 8/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Cooler temperatures and potential frost can hinder onion growth</update>
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Use plastic tunnels or greenhouses for protection</update>
- <update>Choose cold-tolerant varieties</update>
