## Description:
Mustard seeds, either whole or grounded, are used in culinary preparations. Young mustard shoots cut two or three weeks after sowing form the mustard ingredient of the traditional British salad, mustard and cress.<update>Mustard plants have glossy, dark green leaves and small white flowers.</update>

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** April - May, October - November

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Seeds |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Sow the seeds thinly in rows of two feet (60 cm) apart.<update>For better germination, soak seeds overnight before planting.</update> |
| Soil | Requires a rich soil with a pH no less than 6. Hence, a well drained lightly textured sandy loam soil is preferred. Good soil fertility is essential for obtaining good yield. Add compost or cattle manure during soil preparation<update>, ensuring the soil has adequate organic matter.</update> |
| Water | Soil requires enough water for seeds to germinate. Regular consistent watering is preferable<update>, keeping the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged.</update> |
| Light | Full sunshine to partial shade. If the climate is too hot, may need shade covers to protect the plant.<update>Mustard plants require at least 6 hours of sunlight daily.</update> |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Soil temperatures between 50°F and 95°F |
|----|----|
| Soil | Organic mulches are perfect for boosting soil fertility and will help maintain moisture and soil temperatures<update>, retaining soil moisture and suppressing weeds.</update> |
| Water | Better to water at 5-7 days interval during first 4 weeks of planting and then water at least 10-14 days interval until seeds mature.<update>Adjust watering frequency based on rainfall and weather conditions. Water deeply once a week, ensuring the top inch of soil is dry between waterings.</update> |
| Pruning | Not specified<update>Prune plants if they become leggy or to encourage bushier growth.</update> |
| Weed control | Remove weeds and maintain a clean field<update>, as competition from weeds can hinder plant growth.</update> |

## Harvesting:
Pull the plants out of the ground before the pods are fully ripened, when they are a yellow-brown color.<update>Harvest leaves when they are young and tender, about 6-8 weeks after planting. Harvest seeds once they turn yellow and the pods begin to dry.</update>

## Curing:
<update>After harvesting, spread the plants in a well-ventilated area to dry for about two weeks. This helps to reduce moisture content and prevents mold growth.</update>

## Storage:
<update>Store dried mustard seeds in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. They can last up to 5 years if stored properly. For leaves, store them in the refrigerator for up to one week.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Diamond back moth, Sucking bugs-Bagrada spp

**Symptoms:** Not specified<update>Diamondback moth larvae feed on leaves, creating small holes. Bagrada bugs cause wilting and yellowing of leaves.</update>

**Control method:** Remove weeds and maintain a clean field<update>, as weeds can harbor pests. Use insecticidal soap or neem oil to control pests if infestation is severe.</update>

### Disease Control:
<update>Mustard plants are susceptible to Alternaria blight, which causes dark spots on leaves that eventually turn brown. To prevent this, avoid overhead watering and maintain good air circulation around plants. If infected, remove affected leaves promptly.</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Mustard grows well in moist conditions but can be susceptible to diseases.<update>Mustard is moderately difficult to grow in the wet zone due to its susceptibility to diseases like Alternaria blight.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Monitor plants for signs of disease<update>, providing adequate spacing between plants for better air circulation.</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Mustard prefers consistent moisture but can tolerate some drought.<update>Mustard is moderately easy to grow in the dry zone, requiring regular watering during dry periods.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Water plants regularly<update>, especially during prolonged dry spells.</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Mustard grows well in moderate temperatures but can be sensitive to extreme heat.<update>Mustard is moderately difficult to grow in the mid country due to its sensitivity to high temperatures.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide shade<update>, especially during hot periods, to prevent plants from wilting.</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Mustard may struggle with cold temperatures and frost.<update>Mustard is difficult to grow in the up country due to its sensitivity to cold temperatures and frost.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Protect plants from frost<update>, using row covers or other protective measures during cold periods.</update>
