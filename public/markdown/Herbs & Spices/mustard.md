## Description:
Mustard seeds, either whole or grounded, are used in culinary preparations. Young mustard shoots cut two or three weeks after sowing, used as an ingredient of the traditional British salad, mustard and cress. Mustard plants have glossy, dark green leaves and small yellow flowers.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** April to May and October to November

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Seeds |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Sow the seeds thinly in rows of two feet (60 cm) apart. For better germination, soak seeds overnight before planting |
| Soil | Requires a well fertile, well-drained, lightly textured sandy loam soil with a pH no less than 6. Good soil fertility is essential for obtaining good yield. Add compost or cattle manure during soil preparation, ensuring the soil has adequate organic matter |
| Water | Soil requires enough water for seeds to germinate. Supply water at 5-7 days interval during first 4 weeks of planting and then water at least 10-14 days interval until seeds mature. Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged |
| Light | Full sunshine to partial shade. If the climate is too hot, may need shade covers to protect the plant. Mustard plants require at least 6 hours of sunlight daily |

### Growing conditions:
| Temperatures | Soil temperatures between 10 and 35°C (50°F and 95°F) |
|----|----|
| Soil | Organic fertilizers are very important. Apply well decomposed compost or cattle manure soil preparation. Apply another round 3 weeks after planting. Organic mulches help maintain moisture, suppress weeds, and boost soil fertility |
| Water | Adjust watering frequency based on rainfall and weather conditions. Water deeply once a week, ensuring the top inch of soil is dry between waterings |
| Pruning | Prune plants if they become leggy or to encourage bushier growth. |
| Weed control | Remove weeds and maintain a clean field. Weed management is easier when row seeding is practiced |

## Harvesting:
Pod harvesting is done manually several times since pod maturity is staggered. Pull the plants out of the ground before the pods are fully ripened, when they are a yellow-brown color. Harvest leaves when they are young and tender, about 6-8 weeks after planting. Harvest seeds once they turn yellow and the pods begin to dry.

## Curing:
After harvesting, spread the plants in a well-ventilated area to dry for about two weeks. This helps to reduce moisture content and prevents mold growth.

## Storage:
Store dried mustard seeds in an airtight container in a cool, dark place. They can last up to 5 years if stored properly. For leaves, store them in the refrigerator for up to one week.

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:**
- Mustard Aphid (Lipaphis erysimi)
- Painted Bug (Bagrada hilaris)
- Hairy Caterpillar

**Symptoms:**
- **Mustard Aphid:** Stunted growth and reduced pod formation due to sap-sucking.
- **Painted Bug:** Wilting and drying of plants due to sap-sucking.
- **Hairy Caterpillar:** Young larvae feed on leaves, leading to complete destruction.

**Control method:**
- **Mustard Aphid:** Timely sowing and use of pesticides like Thiamethoxam or Chlorpyrifos.
- **Painted Bug:** Irrigation after sowing; application of Malathion if necessary.
- **Hairy Caterpillar:** Apply insecticides like Malathion or Dichlorvos if infestations are observed.

### Disease Control
**Disease type:**
- Alternaria Blight (Alternaria brassicae)
- White Rust (Albugo candida)
- Downy Mildew (Hyaloperonospora parasitica)
- Sclerotinia Rot (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum)

**Symptoms:**
- **Alternaria Blight:** Dark brown spots on leaves and pods; severe cases lead to wilting.
- **White Rust:** White pustules on leaves and stems; swelling of affected parts.
- **Downy Mildew:** Whitish growth on leaf undersides; yellowing of upper surfaces.
- **Sclerotinia Rot:** Elongated brown lesions on stems; can lead to complete crop failure if not managed early.

**Management:**
- **Alternaria Blight:** Use resistant varieties and apply fungicides like Indofil M-45 or Captan.
- **White Rust:** Application of Metalaxyl + Mancozeb or Copper oxychloride.
- **Downy Mildew:** Destroy debris before sowing and apply fungicides like Indofil M-45 multiple times during the growing season.
- **Sclerotinia Rot:** Monitor environmental conditions closely; apply fungicide when flowering begins.

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Mustard is more challenging to grow in the wet zone due to its high susceptibility to diseases like Alternaria blight, which thrive in humid conditions. The frequent rainfall in this zone can also lead to waterlogging, which mustard doesn't tolerate well.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Monitor plants closely for signs of disease, especially Alternaria blight.
- Provide adequate spacing between plants for better air circulation to reduce disease risk.
- Implement raised beds or ridges to improve drainage and prevent waterlogging.
- Use disease-resistant varieties when available.

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Mustard is moderately easy to grow in the dry zone, as the drier conditions reduce disease pressure. However, careful water management is crucial, especially during dry spells.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Implement a consistent watering schedule, following the recommended 5-7 day interval for the first 4 weeks, then 10-14 day interval until maturity.
- Use mulching to conserve soil moisture and reduce water evaporation.
- Choose drought-tolerant varieties if available.

### Mid country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Mustard cultivation in the mid country faces moderate challenges due to fluctuating temperatures and occasional heat stress. The mix of wet and dry periods can also create disease pressure.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide shade during the hottest parts of the day to prevent wilting and heat stress.
- Monitor and adjust watering based on rainfall patterns.
- Implement good air circulation practices to reduce disease risk.

### Up country (Difficulty: 8/10)
**Explanation:** Mustard is more difficult to grow in the up country due to cooler temperatures, potential frost risk, and higher humidity which can increase disease pressure.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Protect plants from frost using row covers or other protective measures during cold periods.
- Choose cold-tolerant varieties if available.
- Plant during the warmest seasons to avoid the coldest periods.
- Implement raised beds to improve soil temperature and drainage.
- Monitor closely for disease due to higher humidity, and ensure good air circulation.
