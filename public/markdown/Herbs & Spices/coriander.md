## Description:
Cilantro and coriander come from the same plant and an aromatic herbs with feathery leaves and large white umbrella flower heads. In Sri Lanka, it is a popular herb used in many traditional dishes and Ayurvedic medicine.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Best planted during the cooler months of October to February. Temperate climate zones, sub-tropical to tropical zones.

### Planting conditions:
| Propagation | Crush the seeds gently to aid germination. Sow them about 1 cm (1/4 inch) deep and cover the seeds and keep them moist. You can plant cilantro in rows for easy harvesting or you can spread the seed over a wider area and rake it in. |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Direct sowing is preferred in Sri Lanka due to the herb's sensitivity to transplanting |
| Soil | Requires well-drained soil with a soil pH of 6.2 to 6.8. Add compost or well-rotted cow manure to improve soil fertility |
| Water | Keep the soil well watered but make sure it is well drained Water deeply once or twice a week, depending on weather conditions |
| Light | It is heat sensitive. Needs warm weather but not too harsh sunlight. |

### Growing conditions:

| Temperatures | Thrives well in temperatures between 17° to 27°C |
|----|----|
| Soil | Mulching is needed to prevent the soil from drying out. Coriander does not need additional nutrients and keeps around the plant regularly weeded. Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged |
| Water | Water the seedlings regularly throughout the growing season. Needs about 1 inch of water per week for best growth. |
| Pruning | Pinch back flower stalks to encourage bushier growth and more leaves |
| Weed control | Regularly weed around the plant |

## Harvesting:
The best way to harvest surplus plants is to pull them up or cut them. Harvest leaves as soon as they appear, as they become bitter with age. For seeds, harvest when they turn brown.

## Curing:
- **For leaves:** Wash and dry thoroughly before storing in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.
- **For seeds:** Harvest on a dry day, tie stalks in bundles and hang upside down to dry in a well-ventilated area. 

## Storage
- **For leaves:** Dried leaves can be stored in the freezer for up to six months.
- **For seeds:** Store dried seeds in an airtight container

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Aphids, beet armyworm, slugs & snails, bolts

**Symptoms:** Aphids cause yellowing and curling of leaves. <update>Whiteflies and mealybugs cause stunted growth and honeydew secretion. Leaf miners create tunnels in leaves.</update>

**Control method:** Encourage natural predators like ladybirds and hoverflies, pesticide sprays, and regular watering. <update>Use neem oil or garlic-chili spray for organic pest control. Regularly inspect plants and remove affected parts</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** 
- Bacterial Blight

**Symptoms:** 
- **Bacterial Blight:**
  - Lesions may occur on all plant parts and initially appear as dark brown/black necrotic spots with a water-soaked margin.
  - Leaf spots are often angular and confined by veins, clearly visible from both sides of the leaf.
  - As the spots develop, they may merge into larger, blighted areas, depending on conditions.
  - Individual spots are often surrounded by chlorosis (yellowing), and severely affected leaves exhibit yellowing and premature senescence.
  - Older spots may develop a pale tan center with a darker margin.

**Management:**
- **Bacterial Blight:** Coriander bacterial blight is difficult to control once established and symptoms are widespread. The most effective management is using clean seed that has been tested and meets minimum seed health standards.

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** High humidity can lead to fungal diseases. Requires good drainage and air circulation.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Use raised beds or containers for better drainage
- Provide shade during intense rainy periods

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Requires regular watering and protection from intense heat.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Use mulch to retain soil moisture
- Provide afternoon shade

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Moderate climate is suitable for coriander growth.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Monitor for pests during warmer months

### Up country (Difficulty: 8/10)
**Explanation:** Cold temperatures and frost can damage plants.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Use row covers or grow in greenhouses during colder months
- Choose cold-tolerant varieties
