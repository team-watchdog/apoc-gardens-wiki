## Description:
Lime trees are well-suited to Sri Lanka's tropical climate. <update>They thrive in the warm, humid conditions found in many parts of the country. Lime trees in Sri Lanka typically grow to a height of 3-5 meters and can be found in home gardens, agricultural plots, and even in some urban areas. The trees have glossy, dark green leaves and produce small, fragrant white flowers before bearing fruit.</update> They typically need at least 3 to 4 years to bear fruit, depending on the size of your tree at purchase. They also need ideal growing conditions, including plenty of sunlight, adequate moisture, and well-draining soil.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>Year-round, but best planted at the beginning of the rainy season (May-June or October-November)</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Seeds can be directly placed in a pot of soil or place it in a plastic bag. Before planting lime seeds, wash them and allow them to dry for a couple days. Plant them afterwards. Plant seeds about ¼ to ½ inch (0.5-1.25 cm.) deep in containers or plastic bags with well-draining soil. Always remember to keep the soil moist and place them in a sunny place. Germination usually occurs within a couple of weeks. Once seedlings have reached about 6 inches (15 cm.) tall, they can be gently lifted and placed in individual pots |
|----|----|
| Planting method | <update>Requires well-draining, loamy soil common in many parts of Sri Lanka. A pH between 5.5 and 7.0 is ideal, which is typical of many Sri Lankan soils</update> |
| Soil | Requires moderate levels of water to keep the soil evenly moist. <update>In Sri Lanka's climate, regular watering is essential, especially during dry periods</update> |
| Water | Requires 6-8 hours of full sunlight |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | <update>Thrives in Sri Lanka's tropical temperatures, which typically range from 22°C to 33°C (72°F to 91°F)</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | If possible, better to use a potting soil made specifically for citrus trees. <update>In Sri Lanka, a mix of local topsoil, compost, and sand can create an ideal growing medium</update> |
| Water | <update>In Sri Lanka's climate, water deeply once or twice a week, depending on rainfall. During the dry season, more frequent watering may be necessary</update> |
| Propagation | Propagation through seeds and cutting. <update>In Sri Lanka, air layering is also a popular method for propagating lime trees</update> |

## Harvesting:
<update>In Sri Lanka, limes can be harvested year-round, with peak seasons typically occurring from May to August and November to January. Harvest when the fruit is fully sized and light green in color for maximum juice content.</update>

## Curing:
Limes can be cured at room temperature for about a week to enhance their flavor.

## Storage
<update>In Sri Lanka's warm climate, store limes in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. For longer storage, limes can be pickled or their juice can be frozen in ice cube trays.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** <update>Fruit flies, Citrus psyllids, Mealybugs, Scale insects</update>
**Symptoms:** Curling leaves, yellow spots on leaves, sticky honeydew on leaves and fruit
**Control method:** <update>Use neem oil, introduce natural predators like ladybugs, or apply organic pesticides approved for use in Sri Lanka</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** <update>Citrus canker, Citrus greening (Huanglongbing), Root rot</update>
**Symptoms:** <update>Lesions on leaves, fruits, and twigs; yellowing of leaves; stunted growth</update>
**Management:** <update>Remove and destroy infected parts, use disease-resistant varieties, ensure proper drainage, and apply copper-based fungicides as approved by Sri Lankan agricultural authorities</update>
