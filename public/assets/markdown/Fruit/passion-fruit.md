## Description:
Passion fruit is a climbing vine with large, three lobed leaves, little tendrils that wrap themselves around whatever they can get hold of, and beautiful flowers. <update>In Sri Lanka, the purple variety (Passiflora edulis f. edulis) is more common, though the yellow variety (Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa) is also grown. The fruits are round or oval, with a hard, waxy rind enclosing an aromatic pulp filled with small, edible seeds.</update>

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>Year-round in most parts of Sri Lanka, but best planted at the onset of the rainy season (May-June or October-November)</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Extract seeds from the fruit and rub them between a sheet of sandpaper. Soak overnight for 12 hours. For germination, bury your seed in a container filled with a small amount of soil or seed-raising mix about an inch deep. When your seedling is roughly 4 inches high, re-pot your plant in a larger pot, around 6-8 inches in diameter. <update>In Sri Lanka, stem cuttings are also commonly used for propagation.</update> |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Plant seeds directly into the ground after soaking overnight. <update>For stem cuttings, plant directly in well-prepared soil.</update>
| Soil | Requires well drained fertile soils/compost-rich, sandy loam. A soil pH of 5.5 to 6.5 is optimal
| Water | Requires lot of water but cannot handle water logged soil. So make sure the soil is well drained
| Light | Needs full sunshine

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | <update>Thrives in Sri Lanka's tropical climate with temperatures between 20-30Â°C</update>
|----|----|
| Soil | Can handle lots of compost and lots of mulch
| Water | Need to provide regular watering <update>especially during dry periods</update>
| Pruning | Prune in late winter or early spring to encourage new growth. <update>In Sri Lanka, light pruning can be done year-round to maintain shape and productivity.</update>
| Weed control | Mulching helps control weeds. Hand-pull or use organic herbicides for persistent weeds.

## Harvesting:
<update>In Sri Lanka, passion fruit can be harvested year-round, with peak seasons typically occurring twice a year. Fruits are ready when they turn from green to purple or yellow (depending on variety) and fall to the ground.</update>

## Curing:
Passion fruit does not require curing. It can be eaten fresh or used in juices and desserts.

## Storage
Store passion fruit at room temperature for up to a week, or refrigerate for up to two weeks. <update>In Sri Lanka's humid climate, refrigeration is recommended for longer storage. Local markets often sell freshly harvested fruits for immediate consumption.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** <update>Fruit flies, mealy bugs, scale insects, red spider mites</update>

**Symptoms:** Holes in leaves, fruit damage, wilting, <update>premature fruit drop</update>

**Control method:** Remove diseased plant/fruit, cover the mature fruit with paper or a mesh, use organic pesticides for insects and neem oil for fungal diseases. <update>Implement integrated pest management techniques, including the use of pheromone traps for fruit flies.</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** <update>Passion fruit woodiness virus, collar rot, brown spot</update>

**Symptoms:** Wilting, yellowing leaves, fruit rot, <update>woody and deformed fruits</update>

**Management:** Avoid overhead watering, provide good air circulation, use fungicides as a last resort. <update>Use disease-resistant varieties and practice crop rotation.</update>
