## Planting requirements
- Grows in dry and intermediate zones
**Planting season:** June - November

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Propagated mainly by seeds or vegetative propagation. There are several methods of vegetative propagation such as grafting and budding.                                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Planting method | Wood apple seeds are planted in the beds. The seedling plants appear in 5- 10 days. In four to six weeks it is transferred to pots consisting of compost, sand and top soil. |
| Soil            | Requires a soil pH of 5.8 to 6.5. Can thrive in a wide range of soil. A light sandy loamy soil that drains well is ideal.                                                    |
| Water           | Daily irrigation should be carried out during the early stages. Young plants require more irrigation than the older plants.                                                  |
| Light           | Requires lots of sunshine (8 hours of sunlight)                                                                                                                              |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | It can grow in climates that vary in temperature from 48 C and -6 C in the winter                                                                                                  |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Soil             | Can mix manure when preparing the soil and remove weeds from the land                                                                                                              |
| Water            | In the field during dry periods, 10 – 30 litres of water should be administered depending on the plant requirement.  Basin ring system or drip irrigation can be used for watering |
| Propagation      | Propagated mainly by seeds or vegetative propagation. There are several methods of vegetative propagation such as grafting and budding.                                            |

## Harvesting:
Mature green fruit can be harvested <update>typically from July to September in Sri Lanka</update>

## Curing:
<update>Wood apples should be cured at room temperature for about a week to allow the pulp to soften</update>

## Storage
<update>Store wood apples in a cool, dry place for up to two weeks. In Sri Lanka's humid climate, storing in a well-ventilated area is crucial to prevent mold growth.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Wood apple being a hardy crop, there is no serious insect or pest diseases
**Symptoms:** NA
**Control method:** NA

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** <update>Fruit rot is a common issue in Sri Lanka's humid climate</update>
**Symptoms:** <update>Soft, discolored patches on the fruit, often with a foul odor</update>
**Management:** <update>Improve air circulation around the tree, avoid overhead irrigation, and remove affected fruits promptly</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 3/10)
**Explanation:** Woodapple trees are relatively easy to grow in the low country wet zone with proper care. The warm temperatures and high rainfall provide suitable conditions for woodapple growth.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot
- <update>Monitor for fungal diseases due to high humidity</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 3/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Woodapple trees are well-suited to the low country dry zone, as they are drought-tolerant once established. The hot temperatures and lower rainfall are similar to their native habitat.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide shade during extreme heat and ensure consistent moisture through irrigation
- <update>Use mulching to conserve soil moisture</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 3/10)
**Explanation:** Woodapple trees grow well in the mid country with moderate temperatures and rainfall. The conditions are generally suitable for woodapple growth, but some care is required to prevent pests and diseases.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Monitor for pests and diseases, especially during humid conditions
- <update>Ensure proper sunlight exposure in areas with more cloud cover</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Woodapple trees may require additional care in the upcountry due to cooler temperatures and lower humidity. The higher altitude can make it more challenging to maintain optimal growing conditions.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide protection from strong winds, ensure consistent moisture through irrigation, and maintain optimal soil temperature
- <update>Consider planting on south-facing slopes to maximize sunlight exposure</update>
