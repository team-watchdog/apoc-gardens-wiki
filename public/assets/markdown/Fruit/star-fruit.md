## Description:
The star fruit is a tropical plant with a unique star-shaped cross-section when cut horizontally. It is a rich source of vitamins and minerals, making it a healthy addition to one's diet. <update>In Sri Lanka, it is commonly found in home gardens and is well-suited to the country's tropical climate.</update>

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>Year-round, but best during the dry season (May to September) in Sri Lanka</update>

### Planting conditions:

| **Propagation** | Seedling should be transplanted in the main land |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Seedling should be transplanted in the main land |
| Soil | Grows in a variety of soil but it is important to have well drained soil that removes access moisture. Better to have a neutral pH range for soil. A range between <update>5</update> and 7 would be ideal for growth |
| Water | It is not drought tolerant. Keep the soil moist. Consistent irrigation is required. Aim for <update>1-2 deep waterings per week</update> if there hasn't been rain. |
| Light | Requires full sunshine |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | The temperature must be <update>60째 F to 95째 F (15째C to 35째C)</update> for fruit production |
|----|----|
| Soil | Better to mix organic matter with soil |
| Water | A soaker hose around the tree can be used to do a slow, deep watering, but base your placement on a ring that's at about the midpoint of the tree's canopy all the way around. |
| Propagation | Propagation from seed, or from grafting. |

## Harvesting:
Harvest when the grooves in the sides of the fruit are completely yellow, and only the very upper tips of the raised sections are still green. <update>In Sri Lanka, star fruit typically ripens between July and September.</update>

## Curing: <update>Fruits can be cured at room temperature for a few days to ripen further.</update>

## Storage: <update>Store ripe fruits in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Unripe fruits can be stored at room temperature until ripe.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Scales, weevils, bugs, trips

**Control method:** Spray insecticides, neem oil, horticulture oil. <update>In Sri Lanka, natural pest control methods using neem oil or soap sprays are often preferred.</update>

### Disease Control: <update>Prune affected branches and destroy them to prevent spread. Use fungicides if necessary. In Sri Lanka's humid climate, regular pruning to improve air circulation can help prevent fungal diseases.</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Requires consistent irrigation and well-drained soil. The high humidity and rainfall in this zone can make water management challenging.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Drought tolerance is low.
- Soil pH should be maintained within a specific range (5-7).
- Regular monitoring for pests and diseases is necessary due to the humid climate.
<update>- Use raised beds or mounds to improve drainage in heavy clay soils common in this zone.</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 8/10)
**Explanation:** Similar to the wet zone, but water availability may be more challenging. The dry season can last up to eight months in this zone.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Drought tolerance is low.
- Soil pH should be maintained within a specific range (5-7).
- Additional irrigation may be required during the dry season.
- Regular monitoring for pests and diseases is necessary due to the dry climate.
<update>- Mulching around the base of the tree can help retain soil moisture during dry periods.</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Similar to the wet zone, but temperatures may vary more significantly. This zone experiences both hot and cold seasons.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Drought tolerance is low.
- Soil pH should be maintained within a specific range (5-7).
- Temperature fluctuations may affect fruit production; protection from frost may be necessary during the cold season.
- Regular monitoring for pests and diseases is necessary due to varying weather conditions.
<update>- Consider using windbreaks to protect trees from strong winds common in this zone.</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 8/10)
**Explanation:** Similar to the mid country, but water availability and temperatures may be more challenging. This zone experiences both hot and cold seasons with significant temperature fluctuations.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Drought tolerance is low.
- Soil pH should be maintained within a specific range (5-7).
- Temperature fluctuations may affect fruit production; protection from frost may be necessary during the cold season.
- Water availability may be limited, requiring additional irrigation.
- Regular monitoring for pests and diseases is necessary due to varying weather conditions.
<update>- Consider planting in sheltered areas or using frost protection measures during colder months.</update>
