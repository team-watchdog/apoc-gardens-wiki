## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>Year-round in Sri Lanka, with best results when planted at the onset of rainy seasons (Yala and Maha)</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Plant the seeds in a pot for germination and when the seedlings are 1 foot tall, plant them on the ground |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Requires well drained soil that is rich in organic matter. Prefer a soil pH of 5.5 to 6.5 |
| Soil | Requires regular watering in the growing season. Keep the soil moist |
| Water | Requires full sunshine |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | <update>Thrives in Sri Lanka's tropical climate with temperatures between 25°C and 35°C</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | Add compost or manure into the soil |
| Water | <update>Regular watering is crucial, especially during dry spells. In wet zones, ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging</update> |
| Pruning | Propagation from seeds |

## Harvesting:
Ripe papaya turns either yellow or an amber to orange hue depending on the type. Pick them when they are ripe. <update>In Sri Lanka, papayas can be harvested year-round, with peak seasons typically occurring 6-9 months after planting.</update>

## Curing:
Papayas do not require curing after harvesting.

## Storage
Store ripe papayas at room temperature for up to 5 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. Unripe papayas can be stored at room temperature until ripe. <update>In Sri Lanka's warm climate, refrigeration is recommended for extending shelf life.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** <update>Fruit flies, mealybugs, spider mites, and whiteflies</update>

**Symptoms:** Leaf discoloration, wilting, and spots on fruits.

**Control method:** <update>Use neem oil or pyrethrum-based organic insecticides. Implement fruit bagging techniques to protect against fruit flies. Maintain good air circulation to prevent pest buildup.</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** <update>Papaya ringspot virus, anthracnose, and phytophthora root rot</update>

**Symptoms:** <update>Yellowing and mottling of leaves, stunted growth, and deformed fruits for papaya ringspot virus. Brown or black spots on fruits and leaves for anthracnose. Wilting and root decay for phytophthora root rot.</update>

**Management:** <update>Use disease-resistant varieties, practice crop rotation, maintain proper drainage, and apply copper-based fungicides when necessary. For viral diseases, control insect vectors and remove infected plants promptly.</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Papaya can be challenging to grow in the wet zone due to high humidity and rainfall, which can increase the risk of fungal diseases. However, with proper care and management, it is still possible to cultivate papaya successfully.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide good air circulation around plants.
- Monitor for and manage diseases promptly.
- <update>Implement raised beds or mounds to improve drainage.</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** Papaya grows well in the dry zone with adequate watering. The lower humidity reduces the risk of fungal diseases, making it easier to cultivate papaya.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure consistent moisture.
- Protect plants from strong winds.
- <update>Use mulching to conserve soil moisture.</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Papaya can be grown in the mid country, but it may require some protection from strong winds and adequate watering. The varying temperatures and rainfall patterns can pose challenges to cultivation.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide windbreaks.
- Ensure consistent moisture.
- <update>Choose suitable microclimates within the region.</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Papaya can be challenging to grow in the up country due to cooler temperatures and shorter growing seasons. However, with proper care and protection, it is still possible to cultivate papaya successfully.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide protection from frost.
- Ensure adequate sunlight.
- Monitor for and manage diseases promptly.
- <update>Consider greenhouse cultivation for better temperature control.</update>
