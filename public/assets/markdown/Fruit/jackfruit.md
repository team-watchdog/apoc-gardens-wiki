## Description:
The jackfruit tree, also known by the common name jack tree, is a tropical fruit tree in the Moraceae family that is a relative of breadfruit, mulberry, and fig tree. Jackfruit leaves are dark green and glossy, and the trees are monoecious, meaning they have both male flowers and female flowers on the same tree. <update>In Sri Lanka, jackfruit is considered the "tree of plenty" due to its versatility and abundance.</update>

## Planting requirements
- Grows in hot humid climates
**Planting season:** <update>Year-round in most parts of Sri Lanka, but preferably before the monsoon season (May-June or October-November)</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation**    | Propagated by seed, grafting, cuttings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Planting method    | First choose a healthy nursery tree and select a site with full sunshine. Dig a hole 3 to 4 times the diameter and 3 times as deep as the container the jackfruit tree has come in. Remove the tree from the container and place it in the hole so that the top of the soil media in the container is level with or slightly above the surrounding soil level |
| Soil               | Requires sandy or loamy soils with a pH between 6.0 to 7.5. Moderately drought tolerant. Needs well drained soil                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Water              | Need consistent moist soil                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Light              | Requires full sunshine (6 hours)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Fertiliser / Mulch | <update>Apply organic compost or well-rotted manure annually. Use coconut husk or straw as mulch to retain moisture and suppress weeds</update>                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Needs a temperature of 24–28°C |
|----|----|
| Soil | Requires regular watering for young plants. Needs regular watering when the conditions are dry |
| Water | Regular watering is needed for young plants. Needs regular watering when the conditions are dry |
| Pruning | Prune in late winter to early spring, removing dead or diseased branches and maintaining a balanced canopy |
| Weed control | Keep the area around the tree free of weeds to prevent competition for nutrients |

## Harvesting:
<update>In Sri Lanka, jackfruits are harvested year-round, with peak seasons from May to September. They can be picked at an immature stage (unripe) for use in curries, or eaten fresh when picked at a mature stage and allowed to ripen. Look for a change in fruit color and a hollow sound when tapped to determine ripeness.</update>

## Curing:
Ripe jackfruits can be cured by storing them at room temperature until the skin turns yellow. Unripe jackfruits should be cooked before consumption.

## Storage
<update>In Sri Lanka's tropical climate, ripe jackfruits can be stored at room temperature for 3-4 days. For longer storage, cut the fruit into sections and refrigerate for up to a week. Unripe jackfruits can be stored at room temperature for up to a week or refrigerated for up to 3 months.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** <update>Fruit flies, bark borers, mealybugs, and red spider mites</update>
**Symptoms:** Yellowing leaves, distorted growth, honeydew excretion leading to sooty mold, <update>premature fruit drop</update>
**Control method:** Use insecticidal soap or neem oil for aphids and mealybugs. Introduce natural predators like ladybugs. <update>Set up pheromone traps for fruit flies.</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** Anthracnose, Gummosis, <update>Pink disease</update>
**Symptoms:** Brown spots on leaves, fruit rot, oozing sap, <update>pink fungal growth on branches</update>
**Management:** Avoid overhead irrigation, remove infected plant material, use fungicides as a last resort. <update>Prune affected branches and apply copper-based fungicides for pink disease.</update>

## Difficulty Rating

### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Jackfruit trees thrive in the wet zone due to abundant rainfall and suitable temperatures.</update>
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- **Pests:** Aphids, mealybugs are common. Regular monitoring is needed.
<update>- **Diseases:** Higher humidity can increase the risk of fungal diseases. Ensure good air circulation.</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Jackfruit trees can tolerate drought conditions but require more watering during dry spells.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- **Drought:** Trees may drop leaves and fruits during severe droughts. Regular watering is crucial.
<update>- **Mulching:** Apply thick mulch to conserve soil moisture and reduce water stress.</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Jackfruit trees grow well in the mid-country with regular watering and pest management.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- **Pests:** Similar to wet zone, but cooler temperatures may slow down pest reproduction.
<update>- **Soil:** Ensure good drainage on sloped terrain to prevent waterlogging.</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 8/10)
**Explanation:** Jackfruit trees can tolerate cooler climates but require more care in terms of watering and protection from frost.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- **Frost:** Young plants should be protected during frost periods. Mature trees are somewhat frost tolerant.
<update>- **Growth rate:** Slower growth and fruit development due to cooler temperatures. Choose cold-hardy varieties.</update>
