## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>Year-round, but best during the dry season (May to September)</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Propagated from hardwood cuttings |
|----|----|
| Planting method | Plant them with a spacing of <update>5-7 ft (1.5-2 m) between plants and 8-10 ft (2.5-3 m) between rows for smaller Sri Lankan varieties</update> |
| Soil | <update>Adapts well to Sri Lankan soil types, including sandy loam and lateritic soils. Prefers well-drained soil with a pH range of 5.5‒7.0</update> |
| Water | Should maintain adequate soil moisture. Requires consistent watering |
| Light | Requires full sunshine (at least 6 hours) |
| Fertiliser / Mulch | <update>Add compost and organic mulch annually. Apply NPK fertilizer in balanced ratios</update> |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | <update>Thrives in Sri Lanka's tropical climate with temperatures between 25-35°C</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | Add compost and mulch annually |
| Water | <update>Should be irrigated every 5-7 days during dry periods. Drip irrigation or basin irrigation is preferred</update> |
| Pruning | Prune in <update>late dry season (August-September)</update>, removing dead or diseased wood and crossing branches |
| Weed control | Mulching helps suppress weeds. Hand-pulling or hoeing can also be used |

## Harvesting:
<update>Harvesting occurs 5-6 months after flowering in Sri Lanka, typically from October to January</update>

## Curing:
Pomegranates should be cured at room temperature for about a week to improve their flavor and texture.

## Storage
<update>Store pomegranates in a cool, dry place for up to two weeks in Sri Lanka's climate. They can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one month.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** <update>In Sri Lanka, common pests include fruit flies, aphids, and fruit borers</update>
**Symptoms:** Holes in leaves or fruit, sticky honeydew on leaves, premature fruit drop
**Control method:** <update>Use neem oil, pheromone traps for fruit flies, and maintain orchard hygiene. Implement integrated pest management practices</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** <update>In Sri Lanka, pomegranates can be affected by diseases such as fruit spot, leaf spot, and root rot</update>
**Symptoms:** Brown spots on leaves or fruit, wilting, and yellowing of leaves
**Management:** Avoid overhead watering, maintain good air circulation, and remove infected plant material. <update>Use copper-based fungicides if necessary, following local agricultural guidelines</update>

## Difficulty Rating

### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Pomegranates can tolerate high humidity but require well-drained soil.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure good drainage to prevent root rot. Consider planting on raised beds or mounds.
<update>- Implement proper spacing to improve air circulation and reduce fungal diseases</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Pomegranates prefer hot, dry summers and mild winters.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide consistent watering during dry periods. Implement drip irrigation to conserve water.
- Monitor for signs of heat stress, such as wilting leaves.
<update>- Use mulching to retain soil moisture and reduce water evaporation</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Pomegranates can tolerate temperatures between 40°F to 110°F (-4°C to 43°C).
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Protect from extreme temperatures with mulching or windbreaks. Consider providing shade during peak heat hours.
<update>- In areas with heavy rainfall, ensure proper drainage and consider planting on slopes</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Pomegranates may struggle in high-altitude, cold regions due to low temperatures and shorter growing seasons.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Provide protection from frost and strong winds. Consider growing in a greenhouse or using row covers during colder months.
- Ensure adequate sunlight exposure, as cloud cover can reduce light intensity at higher altitudes.
<update>- Choose cold-hardy varieties suitable for higher elevations in Sri Lanka
- Implement terracing techniques to maximize sunlight exposure and improve drainage</update>
