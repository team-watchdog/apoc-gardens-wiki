## Description:
Potatoes are generous plants and they easily grow and produce abundant harvests. They come in a variety of types, colors and shapes.

:::warning
Like the tomato, the potato is a nightshade in the genus Solanum, and the vegetative and fruiting parts of the potato contain the toxin solanine which is dangerous for human consumption. Normal potato tubers that have been grown and stored properly produce glycoalkaloids in amounts small enough to be negligible for human health, but, if green sections of the plant (namely sprouts and skins) are exposed to light, the tuber can accumulate a high enough concentration of glycoalkaloids to affect human health.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>In Sri Lanka, potatoes are typically planted from October to November in the upcountry regions, and from May to June in the mid-country regions</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Plant seed potatoes from which eyes (buds) protrude. Only small, golf ball-sized potatoes should be planted whole. Cut large tubers into pieces and leave them for few days to be "cured" in a warm space and then plant them. Potatoes grow best in rows about 3 feet apart. With shovel, dig a trench row about 6 inches wide and 8 inches deep. Taper the bottom to about 3 inches wide. Spread and mix in aged manure, compost, and/or leaves. In each trench, place a seed potato piece cut side down every 12 to 14 inches and cover with 3 to 4 inches of soil. |
|----|----|
| Soil | The tubers need to grow in fertile (organic), loose, well-drained soil. Using raised beds solves the problem of water logging in advance.<update>Ideal pH range: 5.0 - 6.5</update> |
| Water | Need to maintain even moisture throughout.<update>Water requirement: about 1 inch per week</update> |
| Light | Plant potatoes in a sunny place with at least 6 hours of directly sunlight each day.<update>Potatoes grow best in full sun, but can tolerate partial shade</update> |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Sprouts grow longest at 18ºC (64ºF) while the ideal temperature for tuber planting is between 16-19ºC (61-66ºF). Tuber development declines if the soil temperature is over 20ºC (68ºF) and nearly stops if the soil temperature is over 30ºC (86ºF).<update>Optimal growing temperature range: 50 - 75°F (10 - 24°C)</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | Put a good layer of compost in the furrow, and plant the potatoes on top. Cover them with compost, then mulch with straw.<update>Hill up potatoes when plants are about 6 inches tall</update> |
| Water | Potatoes need sufficient water to prevent hollow tubers and to grow them to optimal sizes. The equivalent of one inch of water weekly is sufficient.<update>Avoid overwatering as it can lead to diseases like late blight</update> |
| Pruning | Propagation: Potatoes can be started either from tubers or true botanical seeds. However, the most popular method is using tubers. Plant either the seed potatoes or the transplants grown from true seed at 18" intervals in all directions.<update>Hilling up also helps to prevent sunburn on tubers</update> |

## Harvesting:
Harvest your early potatoes at any time after the plants have flowered. Late potatoes can be left in until the plants have died down.<update>Potatoes are ready to harvest when the skin is tough and the tuber size is desired</update>

## Curing:
Store potatoes in a cool, dark place with good ventilation to prevent sprouting and maintain quality.<update>Cure potatoes at 50-60°F (10-15°C) for about two weeks after harvest</update>

## Storage
Potatoes should be stored in a cool, dry place with temperatures between 35-40°F (1.7-4.4°C) and humidity levels around 90%. They can be stored for up to 6 months under these conditions.<update>Ideal storage temperature range: 38 - 42°F (3.3 - 5.6°C)</update>

## Protecting your plants

### Pest control
**Pest type:** Colorado potato beetles, Potato Leafhoppers, Leafhoppers, Aphids

**Symptoms:**
- Colorado potato beetles: Feeding damage on leaves and stems, yellowing leaves, wilting plants.<update>Beetle larvae can also cause defoliation</update>
- Potato Leafhoppers: Yellowing leaves, wilting plants, reduced growth.<update>Leafhoppers transmit viruses like curly top virus</update>
- Leafhoppers: Yellowing leaves, wilting plants, reduced growth.
- Aphids: Distorted leaves, sticky honeydew on leaves.<update>Aphids can also transmit viruses</update>

**Control method:**
- Colorado potato beetles: Handpick and destroy adult beetles and larvae. Use insecticides as a last resort.<update>Neem oil and spinosad are effective against beetle larvae</update>
- Potato Leafhoppers: Use reflective mulches to deter leafhoppers. Apply insecticides if infestation is severe.<update>Insecticides containing imidacloprid can be used for control</update>
- Leafhoppers: Use reflective mulches to deter leafhoppers. Apply insecticides if infestation is severe.
- Aphids: Spray plants with a strong jet of water to dislodge aphids. Use insecticidal soap or neem oil as a last resort.<update>Soap sprays can also be used for control</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** Early Blight, Late Blight

**Symptoms:**
- Early Blight: Brown spots on leaves, leaf drop, cankers on stems.<update>Early blight is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani</update>
- Late Blight: Dark green to black spots on leaves, white mold on infected tissue, defoliation.<update>Late blight is caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans</update>

**Management:**
- Early Blight: Remove infected plants and debris. Apply fungicides if necessary.<update>Copper-based fungicides can be used for control</update>
- Late Blight: Remove infected plants and debris. Apply fungicides regularly during wet periods.<update>Fungicides containing chlorothalonil or mancozeb are commonly used</update> Use resistant varieties if available.<update>Varieties like 'Kennebec' and 'Yukon Gold' have some resistance to late blight</update>

## Difficulty Rating

### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Potatoes require consistent moisture and cool temperatures, which can be challenging in the wet zone.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure adequate drainage to prevent waterlogging.<update>Consider using raised beds or mounding soil</update>
- Provide shade during peak heat hours.<update>Mulching can also help regulate soil temperature</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** The dry zone's hot temperatures and low rainfall make it difficult to grow potatoes successfully.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Irrigate regularly to maintain even moisture.<update>Drip irrigation is recommended</update>
- Use mulch to retain soil moisture and suppress weeds.<update>Organic mulches like straw or grass clippings can be used</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** The mid-country's varied climate can be suitable for potato cultivation with proper management.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Monitor temperatures closely, as potatoes prefer cooler conditions.<update>Consider using row covers or shade cloth during peak heat hours</update>
- Ensure adequate drainage to prevent waterlogging during heavy rainfall periods.<update>Mounding soil can help improve drainage</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** The up-country's cool climate is well-suited for potato cultivation.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Protect plants from frost damage with row covers or other protective measures.<update>Floating row covers can provide additional protection</update>
- Ensure adequate drainage to prevent waterlogging during heavy rainfall periods.<update>Mounding soil can help improve drainage</update>
