## Climate Zones of Sri Lanka & Difficulty Ratings for Green Gram Cultivation

Sri Lanka has three main climate zones: Wet Zone, Intermediate Zone, and Dry Zone. Here's how difficult it is to grow green gram in each zone, rated on a scale of 1-10 (1 being very easy, 10 being extremely difficult):

### 1. **Wet Zone** (Difficulty: 7/10)

The Wet Zone receives high rainfall (>2500 mm annually) and has warm temperatures (avg. 27-30°C). While the warmth is suitable for green gram, the high humidity and excessive rainfall can lead to fungal diseases and poor pod development.

- **Challenges:** High humidity leading to fungal diseases, excessive rainfall affecting flowering and pod formation.
- **Adaptations:** <update>Use raised beds for better drainage, implement crop rotation with non-legumes, and consider cultivating during the drier seasons (January-March or July-September).</update>

### 2. **Intermediate Zone** (Difficulty: 4/10)

This zone has moderate rainfall (1750-2500 mm annually) and temperatures (avg. 25-30°C). The conditions here are generally favorable for green gram cultivation.

- **Challenges:** Occasional dry spells during cultivation period.
- **Adaptations:** <update>Implement water conservation techniques like mulching, and time planting to coincide with the onset of rains (usually March-April or September-October).</update>

### 3. **Dry Zone** (Difficulty: 6/10)

The Dry Zone has low rainfall (<1750 mm annually) and high temperatures (avg. 30-34°C). While the warmth is suitable, water stress can be a significant challenge.

- **Challenges:** Water scarcity leading to drought stress, high daytime temperatures.
- **Adaptations:** <update>Use drought-tolerant varieties like 'MI-5' or 'Ari', implement efficient irrigation systems, and consider intercropping with drought-resistant crops like sesame or cowpea.</update>

**Note:**
- Difficulty ratings are based on general climate conditions and may vary depending on specific microclimates or local weather patterns.
- Ratings consider temperature, rainfall, humidity, and disease/pest pressure. Soil conditions were not factored in as they can vary greatly within each zone.
- <update>Farmers should consult the Department of Agriculture or local Agrarian Service Centers for region-specific advice and updated varietal recommendations.</update>
