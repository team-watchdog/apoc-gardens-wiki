|----|----|
| Planting method | <update>Direct sowing is preferred in Sri Lanka due to the herb's sensitivity to transplanting</update> |
| Soil | Requires a well-drained soil with a soil pH of 6.2 to 6.8
<update>Add compost or well-rotted cow manure to improve soil fertility</update> |
| Water | Keep the soil well watered but make sure it is well drained
Water deeply once or twice a week, depending on weather conditions |
| Light | It is heat sensitive. Needs a warm weather but not too harsh sunlight. <update>In Sri Lanka, partial shade is recommended, especially during the hottest parts of the day</update> |

Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged |
| Water | Water the seedlings regularly throughout the growing season. Needs about about 1 inch of water per week for best growth.<update>In dry zones of Sri Lanka, more frequent watering may be necessary</update> |
| Pruning | Pinch back flower stalks to encourage bushier growth and more leaves |
| Weed control | Regularly weed around the plant |

## Harvesting:
Best way to harvest surplus plants is to pull them up or cut them. <update>Harvest leaves as soon as they appear, as they become bitter with age. For seeds, harvest when they turn brown.</update>

## Curing:
<update>
**For leaves:** wash and dry thoroughly before storing in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.

</update>

## Storage
<update>Dried leaves can be stored in the freezer for up to six months</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Aphids, beet armyworm, slugs & snails, bolts

**Symptoms:** Aphids cause yellowing and curling of leaves. <update>Whiteflies and mealybugs cause stunted growth and honeydew secretion. Leaf miners create tunnels in leaves.</update>

**Control method:** Encourage natural predators like ladybirds and hoverflies, pesticide sprays, regular watering. <update>Use neem oil or garlic-chili spray for organic pest control. Regularly inspect plants and remove affected parts</update>

### Disease Control
