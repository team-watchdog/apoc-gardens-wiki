## Description:
Asian Pennywort is a slender perennial plant with creeping stems which root at the node. These generally grows in the tropics. It grows to 10 cm high and spreads to 50 cm across. The stems are creeping and form roots at the nodes while the groups of leaves develop in clumps at the nodes. Leaves are round or heart shaped with a wavy edge. The edge has teeth or indentations along it. The stems and flowers are dull red or pink. The flowers are small and occur in small clusters. The fruit is round but flattened and 2 mm diameter.

There are two types of Gotukola based on its growth habit;
1. Bush type
2. Vine Type

There are three types of vine type Gotukola according to the size of leaves;
1. Type with large leaves (Giant Gotukola)
2. Type with medium size leaves (Meerigama selection). This is the most commercially grown Gotukola type and has a good taste.
3. Types with small leaves (WelGotukola)

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>Year-round in Sri Lanka, with best growth during the rainy seasons (May-September and December-February)</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Cuttings or runners are the easiest way to grow the plants. Place a handful of Gotu kola seeds into a bowl of water, and soak it over night before planting them the next day. Can plant directly on the ground or in a container that has a proper drainage in the bottom of the container. |

| Planting method | Cuttings or runners are the easiest way to grow the plants. Place a handful of Gotu kola seeds into a bowl of water, and soak it over night before planting them the next day. Can plant directly on the ground or in a container that has a proper drainage in the bottom of the container. |
| Soil | It grows best in sunny, moist, fertile soils. Well drained low lands are the most suitable for the cultivation. It required a soil with a pH range of 6-7. Can add lime or wood ash to help with the pH balance, if necessary. The soil must be adequately prepared before planting Gotu kola seeds, as this plant does not grow well in poor soil conditions. To prepare the soil for Gotu kola planting, you need to first prepare your garden bed by removing all weeds and debris before adding compost or manure to the soil. |
| Water | Irrigation is important to maintain the soil moisture. It requires proper watering and drainage to thrive. Water logging should be avoided. If watering frequently, need to have a drainage hole in the container. After planting, make sure to water the area thoroughly. After that, rinse the soil as often as necessary to maintain it uniformly and continuously moist. |
| Light | Gotu kola needs a lot of sunlight to grow properly. It should be placed in a sunny spot where it can receive at least six hours of sunlight every day. <update>In Sri Lanka, partial shade during the hottest parts of the day can be beneficial, especially in the dry zone.</update> |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | It needs a temperature above 10°C. <update>In Sri Lanka, it thrives in temperatures between 20-30°C, which are common across most of the island.</update> |
|----|----|
| Soil | Raised beds or sunken beds should be prepared according to the selected field to facilitate good drainage. Good textured soil with fine filth is more suitable for the growth of deep roots. Both organic and inorganic fertilizers can be applied for the crop. |
| Water | The plant should be watered every day during the summer months and every two days during the winter months. The main target here is to keep moist soil. <update>In Sri Lanka's dry zone, more frequent watering may be necessary, especially during drought periods.</update> |
| Pruning | Pinch back growing tips to encourage bushier growth. |
| Weed control | Hand-pull weeds regularly, especially during the first few weeks after planting. |

## Harvesting:
Gotu kola leaves can be picked throughout the summer months. <update>In Sri Lanka, harvesting can be done year-round, with more frequent harvests during the rainy seasons when growth is most vigorous.</update> The leaves can be used dried or fresh for use in infusions, milk decoctions, or powdered.

## Curing: 
<update>Spread leaves on a clean surface and allow them to dry naturally in shade. Store dried leaves in an airtight container.</update>

## Storage: 
<update>Fresh leaves can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one week. Dried leaves can be stored in a cool, dark place for up to six months.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Gotu kola plant is attacked by viruses and snails. In South East Asia and India, Gotu kola plants suffer from bacterial contamination. It is sensitive to pollutants because it is an aquatic plant.

**Symptoms:** <update>Leaves may develop yellow or brown spots, wilting, or stunted growth.</update>

**Control method:** Harvest regularly to prevent it from viruses and bacterial contamination. To prevent snails, using a snail pellet is recommended. Spreading sawdust will also help to keep away the snails. <update>In Sri Lanka, organic methods like neem oil sprays can be effective against pests while maintaining ecological balance.</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** Root rot, leaf spot, and powdery mildew.

**Symptoms:** Root rot: yellowing leaves, wilting, and eventual plant death. Leaf spot: dark spots on leaves that may enlarge and merge. Powdery mildew: white, powdery patches on leaves.

**Management:** Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot. Remove infected leaves promptly to control leaf spot and powdery mildew. Apply fungicides as a last resort for severe cases of powdery mildew. <update>In Sri Lanka's humid climate, ensuring good air circulation and avoiding overhead watering can help prevent fungal diseases.</update>

## Difficulty Ratings by Climate Zone

### 1. **Lowlands (Sea Level - 300m)**
- **Difficulty Rating:** 3/10
- **Explanation:** Gotu-kola thrives in lowland areas with high humidity and warm temperatures, making it highly suitable for this zone. <update>In Sri Lanka, this zone includes areas like Colombo, Galle, and Matara, where Gotu-kola grows abundantly. Proper drainage is crucial to prevent waterlogging during heavy monsoon rains.</update>

### 2. **Midlands (300m - 900m)**
- **Difficulty Rating:** 4/10
- **Explanation:** The midland climate is generally favorable for Gotu-kola, with its moderate temperatures and adequate rainfall. <update>This includes areas like Kandy and Bandarawela, where Gotu-kola cultivation is common. The slightly cooler temperatures might slow down growth compared to lowland areas, but overall conditions are still very suitable.</update>

### 3. **Highlands (Above 900m)**
- **Difficulty Rating:** 6/10
- **Explanation:** The highland climate poses some challenges for Gotu-kola due to cooler temperatures and lower humidity. <update>In areas like Nuwara Eliya, additional care may be needed. It may require more frequent watering to maintain soil moisture, and protection from strong winds and occasional frost. Regular pruning can encourage bushier growth in these conditions.</update>

### 4. **Dry Zone (North & North-East)**
- **Difficulty Rating:** 5/10
- **Explanation:** The dry zone has lower rainfall and higher temperatures than other zones, making it more challenging for Gotu-kola cultivation. <update>In areas like Anuradhapura and Jaffna, regular irrigation is crucial to maintain soil moisture, especially during the dry season (May to September). Additionally, the plant may require more frequent harvesting to prevent viral infections due to higher temperatures. Mulching and partial shading can help conserve moisture and protect plants from extreme heat.</update>
