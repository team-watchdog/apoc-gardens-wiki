				<p>
					Beetroot is a dark green leafed plant up to 20 cm tall and grows
					throughout the year. It has an oval shape with dark green or reddish
					in colour. It gives a thickened root in the first year followed by
					flowers in the second year. The flowers are small and green. The
					leaves vary in shape and colour. It has a round or elongated fattened
					root. The root is red in colour though there are also white varieties.
					There are many different varieties of beets, showcasing deep red,
					yellow, white, or striped roots of different shapes.

								Water the beetroot regularly to reduce the likelihood of the
								roots becoming woody or splitting. During the first month water
								every couple of days until the seeds have germinated.

								Pinch off flower stalks if you want to prevent bolting and

				<h1>Harvesting</h1>
				<hr />
				<p>
					It can be harvested once it has grown couple of inches from the
					ground.<strong
						>Grasp the foliage firmly where it meets the top of the root and
						pull. Beetroot is better harvested too early rather than too late –
						younger roots are more tender. Beets should be harvested when they
						are no larger than 2” in diameter.</strong

			<!-- Curing -->
			<section id="curing-section">
				<h1>Curing</h1>
				<hr />
				<p>
					After harvesting, cure beetroots by storing them in a dark, humid
					place at around 50°F (10°C) for about two weeks to improve their
					flavor and storage life.
				</p>
			</section>
			<br />

			<!-- Storage -->
			<section id="storage-section">
				<h1>Storage</h1>
				<hr />
				<p>
					Store cured beetroots in the refrigerator for up to three months or in
					the freezer for up to one year. To freeze, first blanch the beetroots
					for five minutes, then cool them quickly before placing in a sealed
					bag in the freezer.

				<h2>Pest control</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Pest type:</strong> Seldom have pest issues. However, leaf
					miners and other beet-specific pests spread from weeds.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Symptoms:</strong> Leaf miners cause serpentine mines on
					leaves, while aphids can cause distorted leaves and sticky honeydew.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Control method:</strong> It is important to keep the area
					clean by removing weeds and crop rotation to avoid the problem.
				</p>

				<h2>Disease control</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Disease type:</strong> Beetroot can be affected by diseases
					such as powdery mildew, Cercospora leaf spot, and root rot.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Symptoms:</strong> Powdery mildew causes white patches on
					leaves, Cercospora leaf spot appears as dark spots with yellow haloes,
					and root rot causes blackened roots and wilting plants.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Management:</strong> Avoid overhead watering to prevent fungal
					diseases. Practice crop rotation and maintain good air circulation
					around plants. Apply fungicides if necessary.
