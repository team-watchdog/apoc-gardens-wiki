## Description:
Cucumbers grow as vine and an easy crop to grow through summer. Cucumbers are part of the cucurbit family so are related to other summer vegetables such as pumpkins and squash. There are several varieties of cucumber. Traditional cucumbers such as Lebanese cucumber produce long, dark-green fruit that is picked from when it is 10cm long. Burpless is a long green cucumber with a thin skin sold as low acid. Apple cucumbers are round with creamy-white skin. Pickling cucumbers are called gherkins and are picked small (5-10cm in length). Cucumbers are 90 per cent water, which is why they feel cool and are low in fat and calories. They are also a good source of vitamins B and C. 

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>Dry season (typically January to March in Sri Lanka).</update> Can be grown through out the year in wet zone.

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Can be grown from seed or seedling                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Planting method | In the ground, seeds can be sown directly into warm, well prepared soil. Sow seeds 12mm deep and 60-90cm apart into damp soil. Press the seed firmly into the soil and lightly cover it.                       |
| Soil            | Need fertile, well-drained, slightly acid to neutral pH soil around 6.5 to 7. <update>In areas with heavy clay soil common in parts of Sri Lanka, mix in sand and organic matter to improve drainage.</update> |
| Water           | Keep the soil moist but not wet.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Light           | Need at least 8 hours of direct sunlight a day                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Needs a temperature between 16°C and 35°C                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Soil             | They grow in loose soil that is well drained and full of organic matter. As cucumbers are heavy feeders, add plenty of compost and <update>cow manure</update> to the soil before planting . A soil rich in nutrients helps build strong plants. Water in well and let the soil rest for a week or two if possible. Spreading organic mulch around the base of the plant helps to keep the roots cool and the soil moist. |
| Water            | Drip irrigation is the best method. Water them in the morning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Pruning          | Pinch back growing tips once fruits begin to form to encourage bushier growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Weed control     | Keep weeds at bay by mulching around plants and removing weeds regularly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
