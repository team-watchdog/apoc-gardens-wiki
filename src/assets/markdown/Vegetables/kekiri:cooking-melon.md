| Planting method | 500g of seeds is sufficient for one hectare of land. One gram of seeds contains 90 – 100 seeds. When planting inter row spacing and the intra row spacing of 1.0m is recommended. The planting holes are prepared as 30cm3 (length, width and depth) and the holes are filled with a large amount of decomposed organic matter and mixed with the topsoil. It is filled up to a 10 cm height. Plant about 3-4 seeds in prepared pits. At 2 weeks of emerging, remove weak seedlings allowing two healthy seedlings to grow |
| Soil            | Plough the soil to a depth of 20-30 cm and crush the larger particles to a slightly rougher texture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Growing conditions:
| **Temperatures** | 30 – 35°C                                                                                                                                                                    |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Water            | Watering every 3-4 days is sufficient depending on the requirement and climatic conditions. Unnecessary irrigation can cause vines and seed rotting.                         |
| Pruning          | <update>Remove excess vines to promote fruit development</update>                                                                                                            |
| Weed control     | Control weeds in early stages                                                                                                                                                |

## Harvesting:
Harvest mature fruit by cutting stalk with a sharp knife. Yield: 25,000 – 30,000 kgs per hectare.

## Pest control
**Pest type:** Melon fly, Aulacophora beetle, Epilachna beetle, aphid, white fly
**Symptoms:** 
**Control method:** Maintain field sanitation, use good quality seeds, mulching recommended. <update>Also consider using organic pesticides like neem oil or soap sprays for aphids and white flies. Use fruit fly traps and pheromone lures for melon fly control. Implement crop rotation to reduce pest buildup.</update>

## Difficulty Ratings by Climate Zone in Sri Lanka
### 1. **Humid Tropical Lowlands (Sea Level - 100m)**
- *Difficulty Rating:* 6/10
- *Explanation:* This zone has suitable temperatures (27-32°C) for Kekiri, but high humidity can increase the risk of fungal diseases and pests like aphids. Regular monitoring and organic pest control methods are crucial.

### 2. **Humid Tropical Wet Zone (100m - 500m)**
- *Difficulty Rating:* 7/10
- *Explanation:* This zone has adequate temperatures (24-30°C) but receives high rainfall (>2,500mm), which can lead to waterlogging and increased pest activity. Good drainage and regular irrigation management are essential.

### 3. **Humid Tropical Dry Zone (500m - 1,500m)**
- *Difficulty Rating:* 5/10
- *Explanation:* This zone has suitable temperatures (24-30°C) but experiences a distinct dry season (<update>1,750mm annual rainfall</update>). Irrigation will be necessary during the dry season. Mulching can help retain soil moisture.

### 4. **Subtropical Highlands (>1,500m)**
- *Difficulty Rating:* 8/10
- *Explanation:* This zone has cooler temperatures (16-27°C), which are at the lower end of Kekiri's tolerance range. Growth may be slower, and fruits might have reduced sweetness. Greenhouse cultivation or row covers could help maintain warmer temperatures.

Each climate zone presents unique challenges for growing Kekiri/Cooking Melon in Sri Lanka. Careful management of water, pests, and temperature will be crucial for successful cultivation in each zone.
