## Description:
A vining plant that grows much like cucumbers or melons in the hot summer sun. The vines of bitter gourd can grow upto 150 to 190 inches in length. Hence, it’s recommended to keep pruning the plant regularly and use a vertical support to save on space. The leaves of bitter gourds are prominently lobbed while the skin of the bitter gourds fruits are warty and highly ribbed. Under the skin, the flesh of bitter gourds is creamy white and firm.

Department of Agriculture has released the following seed varieties: MC 43, Thinneweli white, Mathale Green, Neerogi, MG.

<update>**Fruiting season:** Bitter gourd fruits from June to October in Sri Lanka.</update>

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** Year round cultivation can be allowed for suitable areas
**Maha season:** October to November
**Yala season:** April, May

### Planting conditions:
- Can be successfully cultivated up to above 1200m of the sea level.
| **Propagation** | 6 kg of seeds required per 1 hectare. Nursery can be prepared with seeds directly placed in sand trays or beds. Plough the soil to 30 cm in depth and build small soil hills filled with compost and surface soil. Plant 3 seeds per hill at 2-3 cm depth for direct seeding. Plants can be transferred from nursery to field directly within 10 days. If more time is required, plants can be transferred to pots for another two weeks. |
|----|----|
| **Soil** | Well drained soil with more compost content and pH range from 5’5 – 7’5 is suitable. <update>Ideal soil temperature for germination is between 21°C - 30°C.</update> |
| **Water** | Good supply of water needed |
| **Light** | Minimum of 6 to 8 hours of sunlight per day |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Optimal temperatures are in the range of 24–27C <update>Bitter gourds can tolerate temperatures up to 35°C but growth may be reduced.</update> |
|----|----|
| **Soil** | Verticle trellising recommended to save space. Three weeks after planting the vines can be trained along a mesh or stakes. Trellis should be spaced at 1.5 m x 1 m. Lateral branches at lower parts of the plants can be pruned. <update>Apply organic mulch around the base of the plant to retain soil moisture and suppress weeds.</update> |
| **Water** | Bitter melon likes a lot of water and humidity. The soil needs to be kept moist throughout the growing season, checking it more often in hot weather. Water whenever the surface soil dries out. Sufficient soil water content needs to be maintained throughout. Water lodging will damage the plants. It is suitable to use soil cover to protect soil moisture during dry periods. <update>Apply 1-2 inches of water per week, adjusting based on rainfall and temperature.</update> |
| **Propagation** | Seeds |

## Harvesting:
Bitter gourds will start fruiting within 55 to 60 days after sowing. Start harvesting bitter gourds once they are 4-5 inches in length and are of dark green colour. If the fruits are left to ripen on the vine longer than this, they will start changing colour to pale orange and become unpalatable. Snip bitter gourd fruits every 2-3 days with a sharp knife to promote new fruiting through the season.

Average yield: 20 t/ha for OP varieties and 20-30 t/ha for hybrid variety <update>Yield can be increased by applying organic fertilizer such as compost or manure.</update>

## Curing:
<update>After harvesting, cure bitter gourds at room temperature for a week to enhance their bitterness and flavor. Store in a cool, dry place with good ventilation.</update>

## Storage
<update>Bitter gourds can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Wrap them in a plastic bag and store in the crisper drawer. For long-term storage, bitter gourds can be frozen after blanching.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:**
- Fungal diseases: Powdery mildew, Downy mildew, Collar rot/Root rot, Gummy Stem Blight
- Bacterial diseases: Bacterial wilt
- Viral diseases: Leaf Curl Virus, Papaya Ring Spot Virus, Cucumber Mosaic Virus, Zucchini Yellow Mosaic Virus
- Pytoplasma Disease: Phytoplasma disease of cucurbits

**Symptoms:** <update>Leaf spots, wilting, yellowing, and distorted leaves; fruit spots, scabs, and rot; stunted growth.</update>

**Control method:**
- Distraction of infected plant debris
- Destroy infected plants with soil
- Improve drainage
- Crop rotation with non-susceptible crops (okra, maize)
- Mixed cropping with cruciferae crops
- Avoid movement of equipment from infected fields to non-infected field <update>Also, use organic pesticides such as neem oil or soap sprays for insect control.</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** [EMPTY]

**Symptoms:** [EMPTY]

**Management:** [EMPTY]

## Difficulty Rating

### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Bitter gourds can be challenging to grow in the wet zone due to high humidity and rainfall, which can increase the risk of fungal diseases.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Regularly monitor plants for signs of disease. Provide good air circulation by spacing plants appropriately and using trellises.</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Bitter gourds can tolerate the dry zone's heat but require consistent watering to prevent stress.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Mulch around plants to retain soil moisture. Water deeply and regularly, adjusting for temperature and rainfall.</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Bitter gourds can be grown in the mid country with proper care, but they may require protection from strong winds.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Provide windbreaks or stake plants to protect them from strong winds. Ensure consistent water supply during dry periods.</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Bitter gourds can be challenging to grow in the upcountry due to cooler temperatures and shorter growing seasons.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- <update>Provide additional warmth by using black plastic mulch or row covers. Ensure consistent water supply, especially during flowering and fruiting stages.</update>
