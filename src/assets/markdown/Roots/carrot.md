## Description:
Carrots are a root vegetable that is grown from seed. It normally grows an expanded root one year and then forms a flower the next year. It can grow up to 60 cm high and spread to 50 cm wide. The root is long in shape and orange in colour. The stem is erect, tough and furrowed. The leaves are feathery and divided 3 times. The flowers are white and lacy. Sometimes flowers are only produced into the second year of growth, depending on temperature.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>In Sri Lanka, carrots are typically planted from September to February in the upcountry regions, and from October to January in the mid-country regions.</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Seeds can be mixed with sand before sowing to allow a more even distribution of plants. A spacing of 5 cm apart in rows 15–20 cm apart is suitable. Often this spacing is achieved by thinning out excess plants. Seeds can be planted on raised beds. In Sri Lanka, raised beds are particularly useful during the monsoon season to prevent waterlogging.|
|----|----|
| Planting method | Direct sowing|
| Soil | Carrots require a deep loose soil. It grows best with a pH of 6.0-7.0. Carrots are frost resistant. Avoid crusty soil through maintaining consistent moisture in the soil. In Sri Lanka, adding organic matter to improve soil structure is crucial, especially in areas with heavy clay soils.|
| Water | Need to maintain a consistently moist soil in the carrot bed. In dry zones of Sri Lanka, more frequent watering may be necessary.|
| Light | Carrots require six to eight hours of direct sunlight a day. Providing afternoon shade or planting in filtered light can give carrots the amount of light they need while keeping soil temperatures lower during the hottest part of the day. <update>In Sri Lanka's hot climate, shade netting or intercropping with taller plants can help protect carrots from excessive heat.</update>

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | Seed germinate well in the temperature range 7–24°C. Plants grow well with a temperature about 15°C. <update>In Sri Lanka, carrots are best grown in cooler upcountry regions or during cooler seasons in other areas.</update>|
|----|----|
| Soil | Root vegetables grow faster in loose, loamy, or sandy soils. To lighten heavy soil in carrot beds, incorporate sand, low-nitrogen compost, wood shavings, shredded leaf mulch, or chopped straw. Avoid adding animal manures as these are often nitrogen-rich. <update>In Sri Lanka, coconut coir can be an excellent local alternative for improving soil structure.</update>|
| Water | Daily watering is required to maintain the moisture in the soil. Therefore, provide light, frequent irrigation to obtained good yield. <update>In Sri Lanka's dry zones, drip irrigation systems can be particularly effective.</update>|
| Pruning | Not necessary|
| Weed control | Hand-pulling or hoeing

## Harvesting:
Large Carrots can be harvested in 12-18 weeks. <update>In Sri Lanka, harvesting is typically done during the cooler months of December to March.</update>

## Curing:
<update>Store carrots in a cool, humid place for 2-3 weeks to improve flavour and texture.</update>

## Storage
<update>Store carrots in the refrigerator crisper drawer for up to 4 months. Alternatively, they can be frozen or canned. Where refrigeration may not always be available, carrots can be stored in cool, dark places or processed into pickles for longer preservation.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Aphids, Carrot Rust Flies, Carrot Weevils, Cutworms, Leafhoppers, Root-Knot Nematodes, Wireworms

**Symptoms:** Stunted growth, yellowing leaves, wilting, holes in leaves

**Control method:** Keep the surrounding areas of the plant weed free, apply insecticides and neem oil. <update>In Sri Lanka, traditional organic pesticides like neem oil and garlic-chili spray are commonly used.</update>

### Disease Control
**Disease type:** Fusarium wilt, Alternaria leaf blight

**Symptoms:** Wilted leaves, yellowing or browning leaves, lesions on roots

**Management:** Avoid overhead watering, rotate crops, use disease-resistant varieties. <update>In Sri Lanka's humid climate, proper spacing and good air circulation are crucial to prevent fungal diseases.</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 7/10)
**Explanation:** Carrots can be challenging to grow in heavy soils and high humidity.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Heavy soil: Incorporate sand or compost
- High humidity: Provide good air circulation
<update>- Excessive rainfall: Use raised beds and improve drainage</update>

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Carrots prefer consistent moisture, so irrigation may be necessary.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Drought: Irrigate regularly
- High temperatures: Provide afternoon shade
<update>- Water scarcity: Implement water-efficient irrigation systems like drip irrigation</update>

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Carrots grow well in the mid-country's cooler temperatures.

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Heavy soil: Incorporate sand or compost
- Strong winds: Provide plant support
<update>- Varying rainfall: Adjust watering based on seasonal patterns</update>

### Up country (Difficulty: 4/10)
**Explanation:** <update>Carrots thrive in the up-country's cooler temperatures, making it the ideal region for carrot cultivation in Sri Lanka.</update>

**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Cold temperatures: Use row covers or cloches
- Short growing season: Choose fast-growing varieties
<update>- Steep terrain: Implement terracing and soil conservation practices</update>
