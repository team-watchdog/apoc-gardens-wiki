## Description:
Slender Amaranth is an erect or spreading herb that grows up to 80 cm tall. The stems are angular and curve in a zigzag manner, often branching from the base upwards. The leaves are oval, wedge shaped at the base with a sharp point at the tip. The side veins can be clearly seen under the leaf. The leaves are without hairs but are sometimes tinged with purple. The flower spikes can be 1–10 cm long and have side clusters. The fruit are smooth and pale.

## Planting requirements
**Planting season:** <update>Can be grown year-round in Sri Lanka, but best planted at the onset of monsoon seasons</update>

### Planting conditions:
| **Propagation** | Plants can be grown from seed.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Planting method | This can be broadcast and be grown in wide rows. Sow seeds 1/4 inch deep leaving 6 inches space between plants (15cm) apart. Cover seeds with a half inch of sifted compost to keep the soil from crusting.                    |
| Soil            | It will grow well in average soils and will even grow adequately in poor soils. Only dense clay mixtures are likely to be completely unsuitable for amaranth while very rich soils might hinder flowering and seed production. |
| Water           | Requires well drained soil. Keep the soil evenly moist while providing a steady supply of moisture to produce the best quality leaves.                                                                                         |
| Light           | Requires full sun to partial shade                                                                                                                                                                                             |

### Growing conditions:

| **Temperatures** | <update>Thrives in Sri Lanka's tropical climate with temperatures between 25°C to 35°C. Can tolerate higher temperatures with proper irrigation.</update>                                                                                     |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Soil             | Cover seeds with a half inch of sifted compost to keep the soil from crusting and to support germination. Remove weed around the plant to eliminate competition for moisture and nutrients. If possible, add mulch to conserve soil moisture. |
| Water            | The plant has an average need for water, requiring no more than one inch per week. However, do not overwater the plant.                                                                                                                       |
| Pruning          | Pinch back growing tips to encourage bushier growth.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Weed control     | Remove weed around the plant to eliminate competition for moisture and nutrients.                                                                                                                                                             |

## Harvesting:
Pick leaves as needed. <update>In Sri Lanka, harvesting can begin about 3-4 weeks after planting.</update>

## Curing: 
<update>Harvest leaves when they are young and tender, before flowers appear.</update>

## Storage: 
<update>Store in a damp cloth or plastic bag in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. Can also be sun-dried for longer storage.</update>

## Protecting your plants
### Pest control
**Pest type:** Tarnished plant bug, Amaranth weevil

**Symptoms:** <update>Leaves with small holes, webbing on leaves, and distorted growth.</update>

**Control method:** Insecticidal soaps and floating row covers placed over the plant to protect from pests.

### Disease Control: 
<update>Prevent fungal diseases by providing good air circulation, avoiding overhead watering, and using disease-resistant varieties when available.</update>

## Difficulty Rating
### Low country wet zone (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** Chinese Spinach grows well in the wet zone due to abundant rainfall and suitable temperatures.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging.
- Monitor for fungal diseases due to high humidity.

### Low country dry zone (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** The dry zone requires more attention to irrigation, but Chinese Spinach can still thrive with proper care.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Implement drip irrigation or regular watering.
- Use mulch to conserve soil moisture.

### Mid country (Difficulty: 5/10)
**Explanation:** The mid country provides a balanced climate for Chinese Spinach growth.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Protect from occasional strong winds.
- Adjust watering based on rainfall patterns.

### Up country (Difficulty: 6/10)
**Explanation:** Cooler temperatures in the up country may slow growth, but Chinese Spinach can still be cultivated successfully.
**Challenges/Adaptations:**
- Choose sunny locations to maximize growth.
- Use row covers during cooler periods.
